## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

I built an AI-powered Polymarket scanner with my agent squad.

It tracks whale wallets, flags unusual volume spikes, and monitors "NegRisk" markets (bets on things NOT happening).

Week 1 results: 12 alerts. 8 turned profitable within 48 hours.

Here's what we found. 🧵

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)

Most people treat prediction markets like sports betting.

They read headlines, pick a side, hope for the best.

But the smart money moves 12-48 hours before the crowd even knows something's happening.

The edge isn't predicting the future. It's watching the people who already know.

---

### Tweet 3 (The Build)

So I built a scanner that monitors:

→ Whale wallets (accounts with $100K+ in play)  
→ Volume spikes (sudden 3x+ increases in trading)  
→ NegRisk markets (negative outcome bets like "Will X NOT happen by Y date?")  

It runs every 6 hours. Alerts me when something unusual happens.

---

### Tweet 4 (Finding #1: The Whale)

**Day 2:** Scanner flagged a wallet that dropped $180K on "Biden doesn't run in 2024" — two days before mainstream media mentioned health concerns.

Position: 72% probability → moved to 89% within 36 hours.

The whale didn't predict anything. They knew something.

---

### Tweet 5 (Finding #2: NegRisk Pattern)

**Day 4:** Spotted a wallet placing $2.4M across 6 NegRisk markets.

Most traders speculate. This wallet was hedging real-world exposure.

Example: $800K bet on "Recession does NOT happen in Q1 2026."

Theory: They're insuring against business risk, not gambling.

---

### Tweet 6 (Finding #3: Volume Spike)

**Day 5:** Market X saw a 400% volume spike overnight.

Three wallets moved $400K+ in under 2 hours.

Scanner flagged it at 6:47am. I researched. Took a small position.

48 hours later: +34% return.

The scanner didn't tell me what to do. It told me where to look.

---

### Tweet 7 (The Misses)

Not everything hits.

→ 3 of the 12 alerts were noise (volume spike, no substance)  
→ 1 was a big loss (whale was wrong)  

The scanner doesn't predict outcomes. It flags when people with serious money make unusual moves.

You still have to do the work. But now you're working with better intel.

---

### Tweet 8 (How It Works)

The agent squad handles:

→ **Research agent:** Scrapes Polymarket data every 6 hours  
→ **Data agent:** Analyzes wallet behavior, flags anomalies  
→ **Alert agent:** Sends me summaries with context + reasoning  

I review alerts, research the market, make the call.

Total build time: 3 days. Cost: $0 (except API calls, ~$12/week).

---

### Tweet 9 (Why This Matters)

Prediction markets are moving trillions in volume.

But 99% of people trade blind—reacting to headlines, not data.

The 1% who win consistently? They're watching wallet behavior, volume patterns, and hedging strategies.

That intel used to require Bloomberg terminals and hedge fund resources.

Now? A laptop and an AI agent.

---

### Tweet 10 (What's Next)

Week 2 goals:

→ Add sentiment analysis (correlate social signals with wallet moves)  
→ Track "smart money" wallets over time (who's consistently right?)  
→ Build predictive scoring (likelihood an alert turns profitable)  

This is the lab notebook. I'm documenting everything.

---

### Tweet 11 (Soft CTA)

If you're interested in:

→ Weekly whale tracking reports  
→ How to build your own scanner  
→ Early access to alerts  

Reply with which one. I'm testing a few ideas and want to know what's actually useful.

No course. No upsell. Just figuring out what people want.

---

### Tweet 12 (Close)

The future of trading isn't "AI replaces humans."

It's "humans with AI make better decisions than either could alone."

Prediction markets are just the start.

Follow along if you want to see where this goes. 🚀

## Follow-Up Content Ideas

**If the thread performs well:**
1. Deep dive thread on the NegRisk strategy
2. "How I built the scanner" tutorial thread
3. Weekly whale tracking report (sample)
4. AMA about AI + prediction markets

**If engagement is high on specific findings:**
- Expand that finding into a standalone thread
- Create a case study format
- Interview-style breakdown

## Alternate Hooks (A/B Test Ideas)

If the thread doesn't land, try these alternate opening hooks:

**Hook Option 2:**  
"My AI agent watches $500K+ wallets on Polymarket 24/7. Week 1: it found 8 profitable trades I would've missed. Here's what it saw."

**Hook Option 3:**  
"Prediction markets are a $10B industry. 1% of traders make 90% of the profits. I built a scanner to see what they see. Week 1 results: 🧵"

**Hook Option 4:**  
"I spent 3 days building an AI-powered Polymarket scanner. It watches whale wallets, flags volume spikes, and tracks hedging strategies. Week 1: 12 alerts, 8 wins. Here's what happened."

---

## Visual Assets (Optional)

If creating image cards for Twitter:
1. **Card 1:** Week 1 stats (12 alerts, 8 wins, 3 noise, 1 loss)
2. **Card 2:** Screenshot of an alert (anonymized)
3. **Card 3:** Wallet behavior chart (volume over time)
4. **Card 4:** "How the scanner works" flowchart

Keep visuals clean, minimal text, high contrast.
