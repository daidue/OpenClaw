# Nate Calloway — X Profile Setup

## Display Name
**Nate Calloway**

## Handle
**@NateCallowayHQ**

## Bio Options

### Option A (Director + AI angle)
```
Customer acquisition strategist. Building businesses with my AI agent partner.
Documenting what actually works — no hype, no grift.
```

### Option B (Results-focused)
```
10+ years in digital customer acquisition. Now building with AI agents.
Sharing real experiments, real numbers, real lessons.
```

### Option C (Intrigue-first)
```
My AI agent runs 24/7 while I work my day job.
Documenting what happens when a marketing director partners with autonomous AI.
```

### Recommendation: Option C
Most unique. Creates immediate curiosity. Positions the "Director + AI" narrative from day one. The day job mention is relatable and builds trust (not pretending to be a guru).

## Location
Leave blank or use "🌐 Remote" — no real location for OPSEC

## Website
Leave blank initially → add landing page URL once Carrd is live

## Profile Picture
- AI-generated avatar or abstract/geometric design
- NOT a stock photo face (feels fake when discovered)
- Consider: stylized illustration, silhouette, or logo mark
- Can generate via HTML→PNG like we did for other assets

## Banner Image
- Clean, minimal — dark background with subtle text
- Could include tagline: "Human Strategy × AI Execution"
- Or just a gradient/abstract pattern (less is more early on)

## Pinned Post Strategy
Pin the **thread post** (#8 from Nova's 10 posts) — it's the authority piece about AI agents as thinking partners. Threads get saves and shares, which drives profile visits.

## First Actions After Account Creation
1. Set bio (Option C)
2. Upload profile pic + banner
3. Follow 30-50 target accounts from reply strategy list
4. Like/RT a few posts from target accounts (warm up the account)
5. Wait 24 hours before first original post (avoid spam detection)
6. Post #1 on Day 2, then 1 post every 1-2 days
7. Start reply strategy on Day 1 (replies are safer than posts for new accounts)

## Account Warming Schedule
- **Day 1:** Follow 30 accounts, like 10-15 posts, reply to 5-10 posts (thoughtful, no links)
- **Day 2-3:** First original post, continue replying 10-15/day
- **Day 4-7:** Ramp to 20-30 replies/day, post every other day
- **Week 2+:** Full reply strategy (40-50/day), post daily
- **Week 3+:** First thread

This prevents X from flagging the account as spam. New accounts that blast out content immediately get shadowbanned.
