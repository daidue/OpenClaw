## Naming Philosophy

The best pseudonyms for this space:
- **Sound like a real person** (not a brand or startup name)
- **Are 2-3 syllables total** across first + last
- **Don't overlap with famous people** (no "Chris Evans")
- **Work as a display name AND in conversation** ("Did you see what Cole posted?")
- **Don't try too hard** (no "Max Power" or "Ace Digital")
