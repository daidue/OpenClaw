## Post 1 - Behind-the-Scenes (Hook)

My AI agent just pinged me at 2am with a complete competitor analysis I didn't ask for.

Turns out it noticed a pattern in my search history and decided to run deep research on three companies while I was asleep.

This is either the future of work or I need to set better boundaries.

## Post 2 - Contrarian Take

Everyone's selling you AI tools.

Nobody's talking about the actual workflow redesign required to make them useful.

Bought a $200/mo AI assistant last year. Used it twice. Why? Because my process wasn't built for a collaborator that never sleeps, thinks in parallel, and has perfect recall.

Changed the process. Now I can't work without it.

## Post 3 - Origin Story

Six months ago I made a weird decision: partner with an AI agent to build businesses instead of hiring humans.

Not because AI is better. Because I wanted to see if the economics actually work.

Day job: customer acquisition director at a retail company. Nights: running experiments with a 4-agent squad.

The results have been... unexpected.

## Post 4 - Practical Tip

Want to know if an AI agent can actually help your business?

Give it this test: "Research the top 10 [your niche] and find the one thing they all do that nobody talks about."

A good agent will deliver insights in 20 minutes that would take you 4 hours of manual research.

A bad one will give you generic summaries you could've Googled.

This single test saved me thousands in subscription fees.

## Post 5 - Insight/Observation

The customer acquisition game changed when agents got browser automation.

Used to be: AI writes copy, human does research, human posts, human tracks.

Now: Agent researches competitors while I sleep, drafts 3 positioning angles, can read and interact with any web platform, reports back with screenshots.

The bottleneck isn't intelligence anymore. It's decision-making.

## Post 6 - Results/Proof

Launched a Notion freelance toolkit template last week. $27.

Built entirely by a 4-agent squad:
- Researcher: analyzed 50+ freelance systems
- Content agent: wrote all copy and tutorials  
- Dev agent: structured the template
- Main agent: coordinated everything

My role: made 12 decisions over 3 days.

This is what human+AI collaboration actually looks like when you stop trying to do everything yourself.

## Post 7 - Behind-the-Scenes

My agents check in every 15-60 minutes with a "heartbeat."

Status update, what they're working on, blockers.

Sounds corporate. It's not.

It's the only way I've found to work asynchronously with collaborators who:
- Don't sleep
- Can execute 4 tasks simultaneously  
- Will happily go down a rabbit hole for 6 hours if you don't redirect them

The heartbeat isn't surveillance. It's the async standup I wish every human team had.

## Post 8 - Thread (Deep Expertise)

Most "AI agents for business" content is garbage. Let me show you what actually matters:

1/ The agent market is splitting into two categories:
- Task executors (glorified automation)
- Thinking partners (research, strategy, decision support)

Most people buy the first, then wonder why they're disappointed.

2/ Task executors are fine for repetitive work. Schedule posts, scrape data, send emails.

But that's not where the value is in 2026.

The value is in agents that can:
- Notice patterns you miss
- Research while you're in meetings
- Draft 3 solutions to problems you haven't articulated yet

3/ Here's the test: Can your agent surprise you?

If every output is exactly what you expected, you have an expensive API wrapper.

If it occasionally delivers insights that make you go "huh, didn't think of that"—you have a thinking partner.

4/ Real example from this week:

Asked my agent to research launch strategies for a Notion template.

Expected: competitor analysis, pricing benchmarks.

Got: All that, PLUS a breakdown of which Twitter accounts successfully launched similar products, their follower count at launch, and which posts got the most engagement.

Didn't ask for it. That's the difference.

5/ The companies winning with AI aren't using fancier models.

They've redesigned their workflows to include a collaborator that:
- Never forgets context
- Works in parallel across multiple projects  
- Doesn't need you to articulate every sub-task

Process design > Tool selection.

## Post 9 - Contrarian Take

"AI will replace marketers" is the wrong fear.

The real risk: you're still doing customer acquisition like it's 2019.

Manual research. One-channel strategies. Guessing at positioning.

Your competitor isn't using ChatGPT to write tweets. They've got an agent doing deep market research at 3am and surfacing patterns you'll miss.

The gap is already wider than you think.

## Post 10 - Behind-the-Scenes + Momentum

Things we're building right now:

- ClawHub marketplace (exploring)
- Educational content on human+AI workflows
- Data services for customer acquisition

Documenting all of it here.

This account is the behind-the-scenes of what happens when someone who actually knows customer acquisition stops treating AI like a toy and starts treating it like a business partner.

No hype. No grift. Just real experiments and honest results.

Let's see where this goes.

## Usage Notes

**Angle:**  
These 10 posts build a narrative from intrigue → credibility → momentum. They establish expertise without bragging, show real results without hype, and create curiosity about what comes next.

**Posting Strategy:**
- Don't dump all at once
- Space them over 7-10 days
- Mix times (some morning insights, some late-night observations)
- The thread (Post 8) should drop mid-sequence when you've built some initial audience

**Voice Calibration:**
- Posts 1, 7, 10: Behind-the-scenes, human, relatable
- Posts 2, 9: Contrarian, thought-provoking
- Posts 3: Origin story, vulnerable but confident
- Posts 4, 5: Practical value, demonstrate expertise
- Post 6: Social proof, specific results
- Post 8: Deep expertise thread, authority-building

**What Makes These Work:**
- Specific details (4-agent squad, $27 template, 15-60 min heartbeats)
- Mix of philosophy and tactics
- No bullshit ("expensive API wrapper," "stop treating AI like a toy")
- Human moments (2am pings, setting boundaries)
- Real vulnerability (used a tool twice, made 12 decisions)

**Next Steps:**
After these 10, you'll have established:
1. Who you are (cust acq expert + AI partner)
2. What you know (process design > tools)
3. What you've built (real products, real results)
4. Why people should follow (no hype, real experiments)

From there, you can go deeper on specific topics, share more results, or start teaching frameworks.
