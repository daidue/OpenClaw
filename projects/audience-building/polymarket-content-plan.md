# Polymarket Content Plan — Nate Calloway

_Data-as-product strategy: treat the scanner as content R&D, not just a trading tool._

## Content Pillars

### 1. Weekly Market Intelligence (Free — audience building)
- "What Polymarket Whales Are Betting On This Week"
- Top 3 market moves + commentary
- Insider score highlights (anonymized wallet data)
- Post to X as thread, repurpose for newsletter

### 2. Build-in-Public Series (Free — credibility)
- "I Built an AI to Track Prediction Market Insider Trading"
- "How My Bot Spots Manipulation in Prediction Markets"  
- "Week 4 Paper Trading Results: Here's What Happened"
- Technical enough to attract crypto/AI audience, accessible enough for normies

### 3. Paper Trading Transparency (Free — accountability)
- Weekly results: trades executed, win rate, P&L
- Post-mortems on losses (more interesting than wins)
- Strategy breakdowns (share enough to be valuable, keep edge private)
- "My AI agent made $X in paper trades this week — here's every trade"

## Content Calendar (First 30 Days of Paper Trading)

| Week | X Thread | Newsletter | Build Post |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | "I built a Polymarket whale tracker. Here's what I found in week 1" | Launch issue: What is prediction market intelligence? | Setup walkthrough |
| 2 | "3 whale trades this week scored >70 insider probability" | Week 2 results + market commentary | Scoring model explained |
| 3 | "My bot caught a $50K contrarian bet 6 hours before news broke" | Deep dive on one strategy | Paper trading framework |
| 4 | "Month 1 paper trading results (full transparency)" | Monthly recap + lessons learned | What I'd change |

## Rules
- Share paper trading results publicly — full transparency
- NEVER share real money trading results (regulatory risk)
- NEVER give specific trade recommendations
- Keep some strategy details private (edge protection)
- Education > bragging — "learning in public, not flexing"

## 90-Day Decision Points
- <50 email subscribers → kill the content angle
- 100+ subscribers but <3% monthly returns → pivot to content-only, stop trading
- 100+ subscribers AND >5% monthly returns → cautiously go live with $5K

## Revenue Comparison
- Trading $5K at 5% monthly = $250/mo (before fees/taxes)
- 50 Pro subscribers = $2,450/mo (no capital risk)
- 5 enterprise clients = $2,500-10K/mo (scales without risk)

_The data is worth more than the trades._
