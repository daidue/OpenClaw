## Post 1 — Hook (Day 2)

My AI agent just pinged me at 2am with a complete competitor analysis I didn't ask for.

It noticed a pattern in my search history and decided to run deep research on three companies while I was asleep.

This is either the future of work or I need to set better boundaries.

## Post 2 — Contrarian (Day 3)

Everyone's selling you AI tools.

Nobody's talking about the actual workflow redesign required to make them useful.

Bought a $200/mo AI assistant last year. Used it twice. Why? Because my process wasn't built for a collaborator that never sleeps, thinks in parallel, and has perfect recall.

Changed the process. Now I can't work without it.

## Post 3 — Origin Story (Day 5)

Six months ago I made a weird decision: partner with an AI agent to build businesses instead of hiring humans.

Not because AI is better. Because I wanted to see if the economics actually work.

Day job: customer acquisition. Nights: running experiments with a 4-agent squad that costs less than one intern.

The results have been... unexpected. More on that soon.

## Post 4 — Practical Tip (Day 6)

Want to know if an AI agent can actually help your business?

Give it this test: "Research the top 10 [your niche] competitors and find the one thing they all do that nobody talks about."

Good agent → insights in 20 minutes that'd take you 4 hours manually.

Bad agent → generic summaries you could've Googled.

This single test saved me thousands in subscription fees.

## Post 5 — Insight (Day 8)

The customer acquisition game changed when agents got browser automation.

Old way: AI writes copy, human does everything else.

New way: Agent researches competitors while I sleep. Drafts positioning angles. Reads any web platform. Reports back with screenshots.

The bottleneck isn't intelligence anymore. It's your decision-making speed.

## Post 6 — Results (Day 9)

Built a freelance toolkit template last week. $27.

Built by a 4-agent squad:
→ Researcher analyzed 50+ freelance systems
→ Content agent wrote all copy and tutorials
→ Dev agent structured the template
→ Lead agent coordinated everything

My role: 12 decisions over 3 days.

This is what human+AI collaboration looks like when you stop trying to do everything yourself.

## Post 7 — Behind-the-Scenes (Day 11)

My agents check in every 15-60 minutes with a "heartbeat."

Sounds corporate. It's not.

It's the only way to work async with collaborators who don't sleep, can run 4 tasks simultaneously, and will happily go down a rabbit hole for 6 hours if you don't redirect them.

The heartbeat isn't surveillance. It's the async standup I wish every human team had.

## Post 8 — Thread (Day 13) — PIN THIS

Most "AI agents for business" content is garbage. Here's what actually matters:

🧵

The agent market is splitting into two camps:
- Task executors (glorified automation)
- Thinking partners (research, strategy, decision support)

Most people buy the first, then wonder why they're disappointed.

—

Task executors are fine for repetitive work. Schedule posts, scrape data, send emails.

But that's not where the value is in 2026.

The value is in agents that can notice patterns you miss, research while you're in meetings, and draft solutions to problems you haven't articulated yet.

—

The test: Can your agent surprise you?

If every output is exactly what you expected → expensive API wrapper.

If it occasionally delivers insights that make you go "huh, didn't think of that" → thinking partner.

—

Example from this week:

Asked my agent to research launch strategies.

Expected: competitor analysis, pricing benchmarks.

Got: All that, PLUS a breakdown of which accounts successfully launched similar products, their follower count at launch, and which posts drove the most engagement.

Didn't ask for it. That's the difference.

—

The people winning with AI haven't found a better model.

They've redesigned their workflows to include a collaborator that never forgets context, works in parallel, and doesn't need you to spell out every sub-task.

Process design > tool selection. Every time.

---

## Post 9 — Contrarian (Day 15)

"AI will replace marketers" is the wrong fear.

The real risk: you're still doing customer acquisition like it's 2019.

Manual research. One-channel strategies. Guessing at positioning.

Your competitor isn't using ChatGPT to write tweets. They've got an agent doing deep market research at 3am and surfacing patterns you'll miss entirely.

The gap is already wider than you think.

---

## Post 10 — Momentum (Day 17)

What I'm building right now:

→ Exploring AI skill marketplaces
→ Educational content on human+AI workflows
→ Data services for customer acquisition teams

Documenting all of it here. No hype. No course to sell you (yet). Just real experiments and honest results from someone who actually does this for a living.

Follow along if you want the behind-the-scenes of what happens when a customer acquisition director stops treating AI like a toy.
