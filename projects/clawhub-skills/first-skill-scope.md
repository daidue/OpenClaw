# First ClawHub Skill — Email Sequence Generator

## Why This One First
- Bolt rated it fastest to build (15-25 hours)
- No paid APIs needed (uses the agent's existing LLM)
- Universal demand (every business needs email sequences)
- Natural upsell from Notion template audience (freelancers need client emails)
- $29-49 price range (accessible entry point)

## What It Does
Takes a product/service description and generates complete email sequences:
- **Welcome sequence** (5 emails)
- **Sales sequence** (7 emails)
- **Onboarding sequence** (5 emails)
- **Re-engagement sequence** (3 emails)
- **Cart abandonment sequence** (3 emails)

## How It Works
1. User provides: product name, description, target audience, tone preference
2. Skill researches the niche (competitor emails, best practices)
3. Generates full sequences with subject lines, body copy, CTAs
4. Outputs in copy-paste format (plain text + HTML)
5. Includes timing recommendations (when to send each email)
