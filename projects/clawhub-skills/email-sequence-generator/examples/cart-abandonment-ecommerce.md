## EMAIL 2: Social Proof + Objection Handling
**Send Timing**: 24 hours after abandonment

**SUBJECT LINE:**
Why Coastal Morning is our #1 seller (2,400+ five-star reviews)

**A/B VARIANTS:**
A) "I've repurchased this candle 6 times" — Sarah M.
B) Still thinking it over, {{first_name}}?

**PREHEADER:**
Here's what 2,400 customers say about the candles in your cart

**BODY:**

{{first_name}},

Still on the fence? Totally fair — here's what might help.

**Coastal Morning** (the one in your cart) is our bestseller for a reason:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"This is the only candle I buy anymore. The throw fills my entire living room without being overwhelming. I'm on my 6th one."*
— Sarah M., verified buyer

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"I was skeptical about paying $52 for a candle. Then I burned it. 65 hours of the most incredible scent. That's $0.80 per hour. My $12 Target candles last maybe 20 hours and smell like chemicals."*
— David R., verified buyer

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"Bought one for myself. Came back the next week and bought four as gifts. Everyone asked where I got them."*
— Michelle T., verified buyer

**Why the price is what it is:**

We get it — $38-52 feels like a lot for a candle. Here's the honest breakdown:

- **Soy wax** (3x the cost of paraffin, but cleaner burn and no soot)
- **Essential oil blends** (not synthetic fragrance oils — you can smell the difference)
- **Hand-poured** in our workshop in Asheville, NC (not mass-produced overseas)
- **Cotton wicks** (no lead, no zinc)
- **Burns 2-3x longer** than comparably-sized paraffin candles

The math: A $52 Hearthstone candle burns for 65 hours. A $15 mass-market candle burns for 20 hours. Per hour, we're actually cheaper.

**Your cart is still saved:**

🕯️ Coastal Morning — $52
🕯️ Fireside Bourbon — $38

## EMAIL 3: Urgency + Incentive
**Send Timing**: 72 hours after abandonment

**SUBJECT LINE:**
{{first_name}}, here's 15% off your cart (expires tonight)

**A/B VARIANTS:**
A) Last chance: your saved cart + a thank-you discount
B) We don't do this often — 15% off before your cart expires

**PREHEADER:**
Your cart expires at midnight. Use code COMEBACK15 to save $13.50.

**BODY:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Your cart expires tonight at midnight, so I wanted to reach out one last time.

I know life gets busy and sometimes a candle purchase isn't exactly urgent (even if your home deserves to smell amazing). So here's a little nudge:

**Use code COMEBACK15 for 15% off your cart.**

**Your cart:**

🕯️ Coastal Morning — ~~$52~~ → **$44.20**
🕯️ Fireside Bourbon — ~~$38~~ → **$32.30**

~~$90~~ → **$76.50 + free shipping**

You save: **$13.50**

[Complete My Order with 15% Off →]

**Use code: COMEBACK15** (auto-applied at link above)

**This offer expires tonight at midnight EST.** After that, your cart clears and the discount code deactivates. I can't extend it — our system won't let me (and honestly, if I extended every discount code, we'd be out of business 😅).

**Quick recap of why people love these:**

✓ 65-hour burn time (Coastal Morning)
✓ 100% natural soy wax, essential oil fragrances
✓ Hand-poured in Asheville, NC
✓ Free shipping on orders $75+ (you qualify!)
✓ 60-day happiness guarantee
✓ 2,400+ five-star reviews

If candles aren't your thing right now, no hard feelings at all. But if you've been meaning to come back — tonight's the night.

Hope to see you,

**Emma**
