- 💰 **Sales Sequences** (7 emails, 14 days) — Convert leads into paying customers
- 🚀 **Onboarding Sequences** (5 emails, 7 days) — Activate new users and reduce churn

Each email includes:
- Subject line + 2 A/B test variants
- Preheader text

## Who This Is For

**Perfect for:**
- Marketing agencies managing client campaigns
- SaaS founders building their email funnels
- E-commerce brands recovering abandoned carts
- Course creators onboarding students
- Freelance copywriters scaling their output

**Not for:**
- One-off promotional emails (this is for sequences)
- Newsletter content generation (different use case)
- Cold outreach campaigns (different approach)

---

## How It Works

1. **Install the skill** to your OpenClaw workspace
2. **Activate it** by telling your agent: "Use the Email Sequence Generator skill"
3. **Provide your details**: Product name, audience, tone, and sequence type
4. **Get your sequence**: Complete, copy-paste-ready email campaigns

The agent will:
- Research your niche (if web access is enabled)
- Apply proven copywriting frameworks
- Generate psychologically-informed sequences
- Output clean, professional copy

**Example prompt:**
> "Generate a welcome sequence for my project management SaaS. Target audience is creative agency owners. Professional but friendly tone."

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I customize the output?**
A: Absolutely. The agent generates the first draft — you can ask for revisions, tone adjustments, or specific changes.

**Q: Does this work for my industry?**
A: Yes. The frameworks are industry-agnostic and adapt to your specific product and audience.

**Q: Do I need copywriting experience?**
A: Nope. The skill includes all the frameworks and best practices. You provide the details, it handles the rest.

**Q: Can I generate multiple variations?**
A: Yes. Ask the agent to generate 2-3 versions of the same sequence with different angles.

**Q: Will this work with [my ESP]?**
A: Yes. Output is plain text with standard personalization tokens. Works with Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, etc.

**Q: Is this better than hiring a copywriter?**
A: For first drafts and frameworks, absolutely. For highly specialized or brand-critical campaigns, use this as a starting point and refine with human expertise.

**Q: Can I resell the generated sequences?**
A: You own the output. Use it for clients, resell it, whatever. (You can't resell the skill itself.)

**Q: What if I don't like the output?**
A: Ask the agent to revise it. If the skill itself is broken, contact support within 14 days for a refund.
