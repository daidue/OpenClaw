# Cart Abandonment Sequence Template

**Purpose**: Recover lost sales from abandoned carts
**Length**: 3 emails over 3 days
**Tone**: Helpful, gentle urgency, remove friction

## Sequence Structure

### Email 1: The Gentle Reminder (1 hour after abandonment)
**Goal**: Remind them, remove simple friction

**Framework:**
1. "You left something behind..."
2. Show cart contents with images
3. Gentle reminder of benefits
4. Address common objections (shipping, returns, security)
5. One-click return to cart

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "You forgot something, {{first_name}}"
- "Your cart is waiting (but not for long)"
- "Still thinking about [product name]?"
- Friendly, non-pushy reminder

**Psychological Angle**: Memory + convenience (they simply forgot)

---

### Email 2: Social Proof + Objection Handling (24 hours after abandonment)
**Goal**: Address hesitation, build confidence

**Framework:**
1. "Still deciding?"
2. Show popular/trending status ("X people bought this today")
3. Customer reviews or testimonials
4. Address top objection (price, fit, shipping, returns)
5. Money-back guarantee / risk reversal
6. CTA: Complete your order

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "Others are loving [product name]"
- "Why [X] customers chose this..."
- "Your question about [product] answered"
- Trust-building, proof-driven

**Psychological Angle**: Social proof + risk reduction

---

### Email 3: Urgency + Incentive (72 hours after abandonment)
**Goal**: Create motivation to complete now

**Framework:**
1. "Last chance..." or "Cart expires soon"
2. Limited-time discount (10-15% or free shipping)
3. Stock warning (if legitimately low)
4. What they'll miss out on
5. Strong CTA: Claim discount / Complete order

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "{{first_name}}, here's 15% off to help you decide"
- "Your cart expires in [time]"
- "Before your [product] is gone..."
- Urgent, incentive-forward

**Psychological Angle**: Scarcity + loss aversion + incentive

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Casual:
- "Oops! Did you mean to leave?"
- Friendly, conversational
- Playful urgency
- Emoji use acceptable

### Professional:
- "Your order is incomplete"
- Business-like but warm
- Focus on convenience and efficiency
- Clear value proposition

### Friendly:
- "We saved your cart for you"
- Helpful, supportive
- "Let us help" approach
- Customer service angle

### Urgent:
- "Hurry! Your cart is about to expire"
- Time-sensitive language
- Stock warnings
- Shorter, punchier copy

---

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Show actual cart contents with images
- Make returning to cart one click
- Test different discount amounts
- Use real scarcity (actual low stock)
- A/B test with and without discount
- Mobile-optimize (most carts abandoned on mobile)

**Don't:**
- Create fake urgency (erodes trust)
- Offer discount in email 1 (train bad behavior)
- Make it hard to return to cart
- Ignore the reason they left
- Send to completed purchases (segment!)

---

## Timing Notes

- Email 1: 1 hour after abandonment (gentle, low-pressure)
- Email 2: 24 hours after abandonment (build confidence)
- Email 3: 72 hours after abandonment (urgency + incentive)

**Why these timings:**
- 1 hour: Catch legitimate forgetfulness
- 24 hours: Give them time to think, but not forget
- 72 hours: Final push before they mentally move on

**Adjust for:**
- High-ticket items: Extend to 3-5 days
- Low-ticket impulse buys: Compress to hours
- Weekends: Don't send email 3 on Sunday night

---

## Cart Content Display

Include in email:
- Product image (clear, professional)
- Product name
- Quantity
- Price
- Subtotal
- "View cart" button (prominent)

**Technical note**: Use dynamic content blocks to populate this automatically

---

## Segmentation Strategies

**By cart value:**
- High-value (>$200): Personal outreach, phone call offer
- Medium-value ($50-200): Standard sequence
- Low-value (<$50): Shorter sequence, no discount

**By customer type:**
- First-time visitors: Focus on trust-building
- Returning customers: "Welcome back!" + loyalty angle
- VIP/repeat customers: Immediate personal outreach

**By product category:**
- High-consideration (furniture, electronics): Longer sequence
- Impulse buys (accessories): Faster urgency

---

## CTA Best Practices

**Email 1:**
- "Return to cart"
- "Complete my order"
- Low pressure, simple

**Email 2:**
- "See why others love this"
- "Complete your order risk-free"
- Confidence-building

**Email 3:**
- "Claim my 15% off"
- "Complete order before it expires"
- Action + benefit

**Button design**: High contrast, large, mobile-friendly

---

## Discount Strategy

**When to offer:**
- Email 3 only (don't train them to wait)
- First-time customers (build the relationship)
- High abandonment rates (test if it improves recovery)

**When NOT to offer:**
- Returning customers (they know the product)
- Already discounted products
- If recovery rate is good without it

**Amount:**
- 10-15% is standard
- Free shipping (often more effective than discount)
- Dollar amount for high-ticket items ($50 off)

**Protect margins**: "First-time buyer discount" or "One-time offer"

---

## Personalization Opportunities

- Show exact items left in cart
- Reference product categories ({{product_category}})
- Use browsing history ("You also looked at...")
- Location-based (local store pickup option)
- Previous purchase behavior

---

## Success Metrics

- Recovery rate (% of abandoned carts recovered)
- Revenue recovered
- Open rates by email
- Click-through rates
- Discount code usage (if offered)

**Benchmark**: 5-10% recovery rate is average, 15%+ is excellent

---

## Legal/Compliance

- Only send to users who provided email during checkout
- Include unsubscribe (but maybe labeled "Stop cart reminders")
- Don't share cart contents in subject line (privacy)
- Comply with local e-commerce laws

---

## Post-Recovery

After they complete purchase:
- Send standard order confirmation (not another abandonment email!)
- Move them to post-purchase/onboarding flow
- Suppress them from abandoned cart sequence for 30+ days
