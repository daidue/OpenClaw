# Re-engagement Sequence Template

**Purpose**: Win back inactive subscribers or customers
**Length**: 3 emails over 7 days
**Tone**: Genuine, no-pressure, value-focused

## Sequence Structure

### Email 1: The Honest Check-In (Day 0)
**Goal**: Re-establish connection, show you've noticed

**Framework:**
1. Acknowledge the absence ("We've missed you...")
2. No guilt, just genuine curiosity
3. Offer value (new content, feature, update)
4. Simple question: "Still interested?"
5. Easy CTA: Re-engage or unsubscribe

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "{{first_name}}, are we still a good fit?"
- "We've missed you (no pressure)"
- "Quick question about your [product] account"
- Honest, direct, low-pressure

**Psychological Angle**: Honesty + respect (no manipulation)

---

### Email 2: What's New + Wins (Day 3)
**Goal**: Show what they've missed, reignite interest

**Framework:**
1. "Here's what's changed since you've been gone..."
2. New features, content, or wins
3. Customer success stories (social proof)
4. What's coming next (future value)
5. CTA: Check out [new thing]

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "You've missed a lot (the good kind)"
- "What's new with [Product] — and why it matters"
- "3 things that happened while you were away"
- Curiosity-driven, value-focused

**Psychological Angle**: FOMO (fear of missing value)

---

### Email 3: Last Chance + Clean Break (Day 7)
**Goal**: Final re-engagement attempt or clean list

**Framework:**
1. "This is our last email unless..."
2. Clear choice: Stay or go
3. Make staying appealing (exclusive offer, bonus)
4. Make leaving easy (one-click unsubscribe)
5. Respect their decision either way

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "Before we say goodbye, {{first_name}}..."
- "Stay or go? (Your choice, no hard feelings)"
- "Last email: here's what you'll miss"
- Direct, respectful, final

**Psychological Angle**: Scarcity + autonomy (their choice)

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Casual:
- "Hey, stranger..."
- Playful acknowledgment of absence
- Friendly, no guilt
- "We miss you" vs. "You haven't engaged"

### Professional:
- "We noticed you haven't logged in..."
- Business-focused value proposition
- ROI reminders
- "Want to reconnect?" approach

### Friendly:
- "How've you been?"
- Warm, genuinely curious
- Focus on relationship
- "No pressure" messaging

### Urgent:
- "Last chance before we close your account"
- Time-sensitive offer
- Consequences of inaction
- But still respectful

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Give them easy outs (unsubscribe prominently)
- Offer real value, not just "please come back"
- Segment (different messages for different inactivity levels)
- Ask what went wrong
- Make re-engagement easy (one click)

**Don't:**
- Guilt-trip them
- Send the same content that didn't work before
- Make fake urgency ("Your account will be deleted!")
- Email inactive users forever
- Take it personally

---

## Timing Notes

- Email 1: Day 0 (start after [X] days of inactivity)
- Email 2: Day 3 (give them time to respond)
- Email 3: Day 7 (final attempt)

**Inactivity threshold recommendations:**
- Email subscribers: 60-90 days
- SaaS users: 14-30 days
- E-commerce customers: 90-180 days
- Course/membership: 30-60 days

---

## Segmentation Strategies

Send different sequences based on:

**Engagement level:**
- Never engaged: Focus on value clarity
- Previously active: Remind them of past wins
- High-value past customers: VIP treatment

**Reason for inactivity:**
- Onboarding incomplete: Simplify, offer help
- Lost to competitor: New features, competitive advantage
- Price objection: Limited offer, payment options
- Life circumstances: "Welcome back when ready"

---

## CTA Progression

1. **Update preferences** or **See what's new** (low commitment)
2. **Check out [new feature/content]** (specific value)
3. **Claim exclusive offer** or **Unsubscribe** (clear choice)

Make every CTA easy to complete (minimize clicks/friction).

---

## Personalization Opportunities

- Reference their last activity date
- Mention features they used before
- Industry-specific updates
- "Based on your previous interest in [X]..."
- Their previous purchase category

---

## Win-Back Offers (Email 3 options)

**For subscribers:**
- Exclusive content
- Early access to new features
- Free resource/template

**For customers:**
- Limited discount (20-30%)
- Free month/trial extension
- Bonus content or consultation
- Account credit

**Make it exclusive:** "This offer is only for folks we're trying to win back"

---

## Success Metrics

- Open rate (vs. regular campaigns)
- Click rate (engagement signal)
- Re-engagement rate (% who return)
- Unsubscribe rate (clean your list)
- Conversion rate (if offering incentive)

**Goal**: Re-engage 10-20% and cleanly remove the rest

---

## Alternative: The Breakup Email

For very long inactivity (6+ months), consider a single "breakup" email:

**Subject**: "Should we break up?"

**Content**:
- Acknowledge long absence
- Assume they're not interested
- Will unsubscribe them in 7 days unless they click to stay
- No hard feelings

**Why it works**: Reverse psychology + clean list

---

## Follow-Up After Re-engagement

If they re-engage:
- Send them to a "welcome back" flow
- Offer onboarding help
- Don't bombard them immediately
- Adjust frequency preferences

If they don't:
- Suppress or remove from list
- Move to "very low frequency" segment (1-2x/year)
- Or permanent unsubscribe
