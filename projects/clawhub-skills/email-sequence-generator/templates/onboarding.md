## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Make instructions crystal clear
- Celebrate every small win
- Provide actual support access
- Link directly to features (deep links)
- Check engagement and adjust (if user completes action, skip redundant emails)

**Don't:**
- Overwhelm with features
- Assume technical knowledge
- Ignore questions/replies
- Send the same CTA five times
- Forget to celebrate their decision

---

## Timing Notes

- Email 1: Immediately after purchase/signup (within 5 minutes)
- Email 2: 24 hours later (Day 1)
- Email 3: 2 days later (Day 3)
- Email 4: 2 days later (Day 5)
- Email 5: 2 days later (Day 7)

**Behavioral triggers**: If possible, trigger emails based on actions (completed first action → send email 3 early)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to optimize the sequence:
- % who complete first action (Email 2)
- % who activate secondary feature (Email 3)
- % who join community (Email 4)
- % still active at Day 7
- Support ticket volume (should decrease with better onboarding)

---

## CTA Progression

1. **Get started** (login, first action)
2. **Complete your first [action]** (core feature)
3. **Try [feature name]** (expand usage)
4. **Join the community** (social connection)
5. **Explore resources** or **Book support call** (self-sufficiency)

Each CTA should move them toward activation and retention.

## Personalization Opportunities

- Reference their specific use case (`{{use_case}}`)
- Industry-specific examples
- Feature recommendations based on signup data
- Progress milestones ("You've completed 2 of 5 key steps")
