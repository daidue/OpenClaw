**Don't:**

- Ignore objections
- Use vague benefits ("better results")
- Forget to ask for the sale

## Timing Notes

- Email 1: Day 0 (start of sequence)
- Email 2: Day 2 (48 hours)
- Email 3: Day 4 (2 days later)
- Email 4: Day 6 (2 days later)
- Email 5: Day 9 (3 days later)
- Email 6: Day 12 (3 days later - kickoff urgency)
- Email 7: Day 14 (final day)

**If using a deadline**: Align Day 14 with the actual deadline. Work backwards if needed.

## CTA Progression

1. **Learn more** (low commitment)
2. **See how it works** (education)
3. **Start free trial / See pricing** (consideration)
4. **Join others** (social proof)
5. **Try risk-free** (objection handling)
6. **Claim your offer** (urgency + incentive)
7. **Last chance** (final call)

Each CTA should feel like the natural next step from that email's content.
