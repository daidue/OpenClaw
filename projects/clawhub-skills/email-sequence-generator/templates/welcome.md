**Framework:**
1. Thank them for joining
2. Deliver the lead magnet/promised value immediately
3. Tell them what to expect (email frequency, content types)
4. One soft CTA (explore, connect, follow)

**Subject Line Formulas:**
- "Welcome to [Brand] — here's your [promised item]"
- "You're in, {{first_name}} 🎉 (+ your [item])"
- Direct, confirmatory, value-first

**Psychological Angle**: Reciprocity (deliver value immediately)

3. The mission or transformation you're committed to
4. Invite them into the journey

**Subject Line Formulas:**

## Tone Guidelines

### Casual:
- Contractions (we're, you'll, don't)
- Emojis sparingly (1-2 per email max)
- Conversational asides ("Here's the thing...")
- Short sentences

### Professional:
- Complete sentences, minimal contractions
- No emojis in body (acceptable in subject)
- Polished but not stiff
- Industry-appropriate language

### Friendly:
- Warm openings ("Hope your week is off to a great start")
- Encouraging language
- Use of "we" and "together"
- Personal sign-offs

### Urgent:
- Time-sensitive language
- Shorter paragraphs
- More frequent CTAs
- Emphasize opportunity cost

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Welcome them by name
- Deliver value in every email
- Build progressively (don't pitch hard in email 1)
- Make it easy to reply
- Use "you" more than "we"

**Don't:**
- Apologize for emailing
- Oversell in the welcome email
- Use the same CTA five times
- Forget to deliver what you promised
- Make it all about you

---

## Timing Notes

- Email 1: Immediately (within 1 minute of signup)
- Email 2: 48 hours later (gives them time to engage with email 1)
- Email 3: 2 days after email 2 (Day 4 total)
- Email 4: 3 days after email 3 (Day 7 total)
- Email 5: 3 days after email 4 (Day 10 total)

Adjust for weekends: avoid Monday morning and Friday afternoon sends when possible.
