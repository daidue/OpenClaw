---

## The Freelance Chaos You're Living Right Now

You're juggling client emails, scrambling to remember what you quoted six weeks ago, hunting through your inbox for that one project detail, and manually typing the same invoice info over and over.

Tax season? That's a weekend lost to receipt archaeology.

Late payments? You're either chasing money awkwardly or just... not getting paid on time.

**You didn't leave your job to become an unpaid accountant.**

The cost? **3-5 hours per week** buried in admin work instead of billing clients.

---

## Imagine This Instead

- See exactly which projects are profitable (and which are bleeding you dry)
- Have every client detail, project note, and expense in one searchable place
- Send follow-up emails without agonizing over what to say
- Walk into tax season with everything already categorized

**This is what that system looks like.**

---

## What's Inside: The Complete System

### Core Business Hub (6 Connected Databases)

These aren't isolated tables — they work together so you spend less time switching contexts:

**💰 Invoices**
Auto-calculate totals and taxes. Track payment status (Pending → Paid → Overdue). Export to professional PDF template (included). See which clients pay fast vs. slow.

**👥 Clients**
Contact info, project history, total revenue per client. Flag high-value clients. Store preferences ("hates phone calls, email only").

**📊 Projects**
Budget vs. actual tracking. Profitability per project so you stop undercharging. Status pipeline from Leads → Active → Completed. Auto-linked to clients and time entries.

**⏱️ Time Entries**
Log billable hours with one click. Auto-link to projects and clients. See weekly/monthly reports. Finally know where your time actually goes.

**💸 Expenses**
Track every deductible expense as it happens. Category tagging for tax time. Monthly burn rate view. Attach receipt images.

**📝 Meeting Notes**
Time-stamped notes linked to clients and projects. Never forget what was decided. Search your entire meeting history in seconds.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a paid Notion plan?**
Nope. Works on Notion's Free plan. (If you have Plus or Business, it'll work even better.)

**Is there setup required?**
Minimal. Duplicate the template into your workspace (2 minutes), watch the walkthrough video (5 minutes), customize your invoice template (5 minutes). You're live in 15 minutes total.

**I've never used Notion. Will I figure this out?**
Yes. If you can use Google Docs, you can use this. The "Start Here" guide includes walkthrough videos for every section. Plus email support if you get stuck.

**Can I customize it for my workflow?**
Absolutely. It's Notion — add fields, change views, rename databases, remove what you don't need. Make it yours.

**What if I already have a Notion setup?**
You can migrate your existing data into this system, or cherry-pick the parts you need (like the email scripts or pricing calculator). Your call.

**Is there a refund policy?**
If the toolkit genuinely doesn't work for you, email me within 7 days and we'll sort it out.

**What's included with email support?**
Setup questions, troubleshooting, "how do I..." questions. Response time is usually within 24 hours on weekdays. I can't do custom builds or consulting, but I'll help you get the toolkit working for your needs.

**I'm using the free Lite version. What's different?**
Lite = just the invoice tracker. Full = invoices PLUS clients, projects, time tracking, expenses, meeting notes (all connected), plus email scripts, pricing calculator, tax checklist, contract, strategy guide. It's the difference between tracking invoices and running your entire business in one place.

**How do I access it?**
Instant download after purchase. You'll get a PDF with the Notion template link and setup instructions. No waiting.

**Will this work for my industry?**
If you invoice clients for services (not selling products), yes. Works for: consultants, designers, developers, writers, coaches, photographers, videographers, marketers, accountants, lawyers, virtual assistants, etc.

**Do you offer a money-back guarantee?**
Gumroad allows refunds at seller discretion. The policy: try it honestly for 7 days. If it truly doesn't fit your needs, email me and we'll figure it out. No hassle.
