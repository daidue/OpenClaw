## 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL (QUALITY STANDARDS)

### What Notion Looks For

#### Value Assessment

- ✅ Contains well-written example data
- ✅ Has instructions where necessary
- ✅ Clean, polished design with attention to detail
- ✅ Simple, intuitive structure (not unnecessarily complex)

#### Popularity Metrics
- Number of visits
- Number of duplications
- User reviews and ratings

#### Price Evaluation
- Is it free or paid?
- Is the price fair for the value offered?

#### Novelty
- Is the use case novel/unique?
- Does it utilize new features in innovative ways?
- Does it incorporate useful integrations or embeds?

#### Visual Design
- Visually pleasing and clean
- Professional homepage thumbnail showcasing the template at its best

- Relevance to current time of year

### Your Template Analysis

## 4. EXTERNAL CHECKOUT vs NOTION NATIVE PAYMENTS

### Notion Native Payments (via Stripe)

**Pros:**
✅ Fully integrated experience
✅ Analytics dashboard in Notion
✅ Transaction emails automated
✅ Customer email collection built-in
✅ Refund processing handled automatically
✅ Access locking available
✅ Content protection during refunds (template automatically removed)
✅ Webhook support for custom integrations

**Cons:**
❌ Must apply and wait for approval (months)
❌ 10% + $0.40 per transaction fee
❌ 1% FX fee for non-US creators
❌ Biweekly payouts only
❌ $20 minimum payout threshold
❌ 14-day hold on funds
❌ Limited to eligible countries (see list below)

**Eligible Countries:** US, Canada, UK, Australia, most of EU, Japan, Singapore, Mexico, and 100+ others

### External Checkout (Lemon Squeezy / Gumroad / etc.)

**Pros:**
✅ No waitlist/approval needed
✅ Start selling immediately
✅ Your own payment processor terms
✅ More flexible payout schedules (processor dependent)
✅ Keep your existing merchant relationships

**Cons:**
❌ No Notion analytics integration
❌ No automated refund processing
❌ No access locking feature
❌ Have to manually manage customer emails
❌ Customer leaves Notion for checkout (friction)
❌ Can't use Notion's coupon system
❌ Template won't show in "Added" section for buyers

### **HYBRID APPROACH**
You can list the same template twice:
1. One with Notion native payment (when approved)
2. One with external link (available immediately)

**IMPORTANT:** If you switch to Notion payments, your existing Notion Site URL will redirect to Notion checkout. You'll need to create a NEW duplicate with a different URL for external platforms.

### Recommendation for "Professional Freelancer's Toolkit"
**Start with External (Lemon Squeezy):**
- Launch immediately at $27
- Build reviews and traction
- Collect customer feedback
- Apply for Notion payments in parallel

**Transition to Notion Native:**
- Once approved (months later)
- Better integration and trust
- Simpler for customers
- But keep external as backup channel
