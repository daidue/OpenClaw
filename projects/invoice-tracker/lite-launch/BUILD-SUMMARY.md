## ⚠️ What Needs Manual Attention

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Before Launch)
1. **Add "📊 Your Invoices" Heading**
   - **Where:** Before the invoice database (between divider and database)
   - **How:** In Notion UI, click above database → Type `/heading2` → Enter "📊 Your Invoices"
   - **Why:** Visual hierarchy needs clear section label

2. **Add Divider After Database**
   - **Where:** Between database and "Full Toolkit" heading
   - **How:** Click below database → Type `/divider`
   - **Why:** Separates invoice section from upsell

3. **Verify Public Sharing**
   - Click "Share" (top right) → "Publish to web" → Enable
   - Ensure "Allow duplicate as template" is checked
   - Confirm public URL works: https://theprofessionalfreelancerstoolkit.notion.site/Freelancer-s-Invoice-Toolkit-Lite-30104dbe0785812fbe10f8f8d33019c1

### 🟡 RECOMMENDED (Polish)
4. **Add Cover Image**
   - **Why:** Visual impact on Notion gallery and Gumroad preview
   - **Suggestion:** Use Unsplash search for "freelance workspace" or "invoice" theme
   - **How:** Hover at top of page → "Add cover" → Choose image

5. **Test Duplicate Flow**
   - Open public URL in incognito browser
   - Click "Duplicate" button
   - Verify:
     - All 4 sample invoices copy correctly
     - Database properties intact
     - Upsell link clickable

6. **Mobile Optimization Note**
   - Add a note in Quick Start or Welcome: "On mobile? Switch database to 'List' view for easier reading"
