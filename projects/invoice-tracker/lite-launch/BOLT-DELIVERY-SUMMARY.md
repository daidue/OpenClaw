# Bolt Delivery Summary: Lite Template Build + Cleanup

**Date:** February 9, 2026, 2:30 PM EST  
**Task:** Build brand new Freelance Invoice Tracker Lite template from scratch + clean up Full Toolkit  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Phase 1: Full Toolkit Cleanup — COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Removed:
1. **Column List Wrapper** (ID: `30204dbe-0785-80f2-8b44-d0574cc18909`)
   - This was the two-column layout we added that wrapped the original content
   - Contained two synced blocks (one in each column) for navigation
   - Created on Feb 9, 2026 — confirmed as our addition
   - **Status:** Deleted successfully

2. **Empty Paragraph Block** (ID: `30204dbe-0785-8016-ae4f-cc86b27984f7`)
   - Empty paragraph at the bottom of the main page
   - Created on Feb 9, 2026 — confirmed as our addition
   - **Status:** Deleted successfully

### Child Pages Checked:
- Quick Wins — Clean ✅
- Dashboard — Clean ✅
- Follow-Up Scripts — Clean ✅
- Resources & Guides — Clean ✅

All child pages had **no orphaned navigation blocks**. They were all empty/original content.

### Original Synced Block:
The synced block ID mentioned (`30204dbe-0785-8121-9468-e8c63f89591d`) was not found in the current structure. It was likely already removed or archived.

### Result:
**Full Toolkit is now clean** — all navigation blocks and wrapper layouts we added have been removed. Original content structure is restored.
