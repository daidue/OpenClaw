# Strategic Analysis

## Which Listing to Use: `free-invoice-tracker`

**Use `jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/free-invoice-tracker`** — here's why:

1. **SEO slug matters.** `/l/free-invoice-tracker` is a keyword-rich, human-readable URL. `/l/ujrthk` is a random hash that signals nothing to Gumroad's search or Google.
2. **The slug `free-invoice-tracker` will rank in Gumroad Discover** for "free invoice tracker" — one of the most searched terms in the freelance Notion template space.
3. **It's not currently live** — clean slate, no baggage. The `ujrthk` listing is live but has no sales, so no loss.
4. **Action:** Activate `free-invoice-tracker` with the new copy. Keep `ujrthk` live too (redirect or leave as-is) — two listings = two chances to be found.

## PWYW vs. Completely Free

**Use PWYW at $0+ with NO suggested price.**

- A "suggested price" field adds friction. Every extra decision = fewer transactions.
- PWYW $0+ still counts as a transaction for Gumroad Discover (the 10-sale threshold).
- Some people will voluntarily pay $1-3 — bonus revenue, but don't optimize for it right now.
- **Goal is speed to 10 transactions.** Remove every possible barrier.

## Maximizing Upsell Conversion

1. **In the Notion template itself:** The upsell callout page should show a side-by-side comparison (Lite vs Full) with a direct link to the $27 product.
2. **Post-purchase page:** Immediately show the value gap (see deliverable #4).
3. **Follow-up email (Gumroad Workflows):** Send 2-3 days after download — "How's the invoice tracker working? Here's what you're missing..."
4. **Price anchoring:** The Lite version being free makes $27 feel like nothing. Emphasize "one-time, not a subscription" vs. FreshBooks at $17/month.

**Expected upsell rate:** 5-10% of free downloaders → $27 purchase. At 100 free downloads, that's 5-10 sales = $135-$270.
