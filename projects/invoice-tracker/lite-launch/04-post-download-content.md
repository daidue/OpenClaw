### 🎉 You're in! Here's your Invoice Tracker.

**Step 1:** Click the Notion link below to duplicate the template to your workspace.

**Step 2:** Delete the 4 sample invoices and add your first real one. Takes 2 minutes.

**Step 3:** Next time a client is late, grab the follow-up email script from the template. Just fill in the [brackets] and send.

**You just solved 1 of the 6 problems that cost freelancers $9,000-$14,500/year.**

Here's what the Starter Kit doesn't include:
- ❌ Client CRM with payment reliability scoring
- ❌ Time tracking for billable hours
- ❌ Expense tracking (tax season is coming)
- ❌ 5 escalating follow-up scripts (not just 1)
- ❌ Pricing calculator & contract template

**[The Professional Freelancer's Toolkit](https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/freelance-toolkit) has all of it — $27, one time, forever.** No subscriptions. That's less than 1 hour of billable work for a system that saves 5+ hours/month.

## Gumroad Workflow (Email Sequence)

Gumroad supports **Workflows** — automated emails triggered after purchase. Set up:

### Email 1: Immediately after purchase (automatic receipt — customize it)
Subject: **Your free invoice tracker is ready 🧾**
> Hey [name]! Your Notion template is ready — click the link in your receipt to duplicate it. Pro tip: add your first real invoice today while it's fresh. Questions? Just reply to this email.

### Email 2: 3 days after purchase
Subject: **Quick question about your invoices**
> Hey [name], how's the invoice tracker working? Most freelancers tell me the follow-up email script is the part that actually gets them paid faster. Speaking of which — if you've got more than 3-4 clients, you might want the full toolkit. It adds a Client CRM that scores payment reliability (so you know which clients to chase first) and 4 more follow-up scripts that escalate from friendly → firm → final notice. **[$27 one time → grab it here](https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/freelance-toolkit)**

### Email 3: 7 days after purchase
Subject: **The $9,000 freelancer problem (and how to fix it)**
> The average freelancer loses $9,000-$14,500/year to late payments, forgotten invoices, and billing chaos. Your free tracker handles invoices. But what about time tracking? Expenses? Tax prep? The Professional Freelancer's Toolkit connects all 6 pieces into one Notion system. **[See everything that's included →](https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/freelance-toolkit)**
