# First 10 Transactions Strategy

## Goal: 10 downloads in 48-72 hours

The bar is LOW. It's free. You just need 10 humans to click a button.

---

## Channel 1: Reddit (5-6 downloads)

**Best subreddits:**
- r/freelance (300k+)
- r/Notion (200k+)
- r/freelanceWriters
- r/webdev, r/graphic_design (if relevant)

**Post for r/freelance:**

> **Title:** I made a free Notion template for tracking freelance invoices — grab it if you want
>
> I got tired of losing track of who owed me what, so I built a simple invoice tracker in Notion. It auto-calculates totals, tracks payment status, and has a follow-up email script for when clients are late.
>
> It's free, no catch: [link]
>
> It's pretty basic — just the invoice database, 4 sample entries, and 1 follow-up script. But it beats a spreadsheet. Happy to answer questions or take feedback.

**Post for r/Notion:**

> **Title:** [Template] Free freelance invoice tracker — auto-calculations + payment follow-up script
>
> Built this for my own freelance work and figured I'd share it. It's a simple invoice database with:
> - Auto-calculated totals
> - Status tracking (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue)
> - 4 sample invoices
> - A copy-paste follow-up email script
>
> Works on Notion Free plan. Link: [link]
>
> Would love feedback — I have a more complete version with time tracking, expenses, and client CRM but wanted to put the basics out there first.

**Rules:** Don't be spammy. One post per sub. Engage with comments. Reddit hates self-promo but loves "I built this free thing."

## Channel 2: Twitter/X (2-3 downloads)

**Post from @JeffDanielsB4U:**

> I built a free Notion template for freelance invoices.
>
> It tracks:
> ✅ Invoice status (draft → paid → overdue)
> ✅ Auto-calculated totals
> ✅ Payment follow-up script
>
> No sign-up. No subscription. Just a Notion template.
>
> Grab it free → [link]
>
> 🧵 Here's why I built it:

**Thread (2-3 tweets):**

> 1/ I had $4,000 in unpaid invoices last year because I forgot to follow up. Built this tracker so it wouldn't happen again.
>
> 2/ The follow-up email script is the best part. Instead of writing an awkward "hey, you haven't paid me" email, you just copy-paste and fill in the brackets. It's been my most-used template.
>
> 3/ It's the starter version — if you want the full system (clients, time tracking, expenses, tax prep), I have that too for $27. But the free one covers the basics. [link]

## Channel 3: Direct Outreach (2-3 downloads)

**The fastest path to 10.** Message freelancer friends, colleagues, anyone who bills clients.

**DM template:**

> Hey! Quick favor — I just launched a free Notion invoice tracker on Gumroad and I'm trying to get my first 10 downloads. Would you mind grabbing it? It's genuinely free ($0, no catch), and it's actually useful if you track invoices. Takes 10 seconds: [link]. Would really appreciate it 🙏

Send to:
- 5-10 freelancer friends/contacts
- Any Discord/Slack communities you're in (freelance, Notion, indie hackers)
- LinkedIn connections who freelance

## Timeline

| Day | Action | Expected Downloads |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| Day 1 (TODAY) | Direct outreach to 10 people + Twitter post | 4-5 |
| Day 1-2 | Reddit posts (r/freelance + r/Notion) | 3-5 |
| Day 2-3 | Engage Reddit comments, retweet, post in 1-2 Discord/Slack groups | 2-3 |

**Conservative estimate: 10 downloads in 2-3 days.**
**If you push hard on direct outreach: 10 downloads in 24 hours.**

## After Hitting 10: Gumroad Discover Kicks In

Once you have 10 sales, your product appears in Gumroad Discover (their marketplace). Free products do very well there — people search "free notion template" constantly. This becomes a passive lead gen machine.

**Post-10 priorities:**
1. Make sure the Gumroad Workflow emails are set up (upsell sequence)
2. Monitor upsell conversion rate
3. Consider launching a second free product to double your Discover presence
