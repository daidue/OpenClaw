**Last updated:** 2026-02-08 10:20 by Jeff

## What I'm working on right now

Executing the launch roadmap. Agent stack just got upgraded. Now moving to distribution.

## What I just finished

- Updated GTM strategy for 2026 (killed Medium, added short-form video, Notion Marketplace as #1)
- Wrote 7 short-form video scripts (batch 1)
- Agent stack upgrade (SOUL.md files, project context, heartbeat, autonomy levels)

## What I'm blocked on

- Taylor needs to upload Gumroad assets manually (thumbnail, screenshots)
- Taylor needs to record 2-min Loom walkthrough

## What's next (priority order)

1. Submit to Notion Official Template Gallery
2. Set up Lemon Squeezy account + list products
3. Publish Lite version as separate Gumroad listing
4. Set up Easytools account
5. Deploy landing page
6. Set up Pinterest Business + Tailwind
7. Check on previously spawned content tasks

## Notes for handoff

All database IDs, page IDs, and asset locations documented in PROJECT.md. GTM strategy is the master plan at `Desktop/Invoice-Tracker-Launch/content/go-to-market-strategy.md`.
