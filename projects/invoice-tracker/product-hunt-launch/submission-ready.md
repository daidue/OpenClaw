## Maker's Comment (First Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this because I got tired of using spreadsheets to track invoices as a freelancer. So I made a free Notion template that handles everything:

📋 **Client database** — contact info, rates, and notes in one place  
💰 **Invoice tracker** — create, send, and track payment status  
📊 **Dashboard** — see outstanding payments, revenue by client, and monthly totals  
🔗 **Linked databases** — clients, invoices, and payments all connected  

It's 100% free — no catch, no paywall. I'm building Notion templates for freelancers and wanted to start by solving the most annoying problem first.

If you need something more comprehensive, I also have a full Professional Freelancer's Toolkit ($27) that adds project management, time tracking, and expense tracking. But the free version covers invoicing completely.

Would love your feedback! What features would make this even more useful?
