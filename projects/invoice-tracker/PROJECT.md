# The Professional Freelancer's Toolkit on Notion

**Status:** Pre-Launch
**Owner:** Taylor + Jeff
**Started:** 2026-02-05
**Target:** Launch Week of 2026-02-10

## Goal

Launch a $27 Notion template for freelancers that replaces SaaS invoicing tools. Generate first 50-100 sales in month 1.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Template built and expert-reviewed (95.3/100)
- [x] All sales copy and assets ready
- [x] Free Lite version built
- [ ] Listed on 3+ platforms (Notion Marketplace, Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy)
- [ ] 10+ sales in first week
- [ ] 50+ sales in first month
- [ ] Email list of 200+ from Lite downloads

## Current Status

Template is launch-ready. All copy, assets, and content are prepared. Need to execute distribution: submit to Notion Marketplace, set up Lemon Squeezy/Easytools, publish Lite as separate listing, deploy landing page, and begin short-form video content.

## Recent Decisions

- **2026-02-08:** Price $27 (not $37) for launch. Raise after social proof.
- **2026-02-08:** Killed Medium from GTM. Added short-form video as Tier 1.
- **2026-02-08:** Added Notion Marketplace as #1 priority channel.
- **2026-02-08:** Added Lemon Squeezy + Easytools alongside Gumroad.
- **2026-02-07:** Minimalist design — no branded covers, emoji icons only.

## Active Blockers

- [ ] **Taylor needs to upload Gumroad assets manually** — thumbnail, screenshots, profile pic (drag-drop can't be automated)
- [ ] **Taylor needs to record 2-min Loom walkthrough** — biggest remaining conversion driver
- [ ] **Need Notion template share link** for Gumroad content delivery
