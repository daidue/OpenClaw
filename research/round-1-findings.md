# Expert Panel Review — Round 1 Findings

## Average Score: 70.2/100

## Critical Blockers (MUST FIX):

### 1. Product Name Mismatch
- **Issue:** Notion template title = "The Professional Freelancer's Toolkit"
- **Sales copy** = "Freelance Invoice Tracker"
- **Impact:** Breaks trust immediately. Customer downloads wrong-named product.
- **Fix:** Rename Notion template to match sales copy OR rebrand entire sales funnel

### 2. Feature Count Inconsistencies
- Cover image: "6 Databases, 14 Email Scripts"
- Sales copy v2: "4 Integrated Databases"
- Email sequence: "5 professional email scripts" + "9 bonus templates"
- **Impact:** Looks unprofessional, suggests creator doesn't know their own product
- **Fix:** Audit actual template, count databases/scripts, update ALL copy to match reality

### 3. Gumroad Listing 404
- **Issue:** Product page returns 404 Not Found
- **Impact:** Cannot purchase. Launch is blocked.
- **Fix:** Publish Gumroad listing immediately with proper product description

### 4. Dashboard Underwhelming
- **Issue:** Dashboard page is just linked database views, no actual metrics
- **Impact:** First impression falls flat. Doesn't justify $37 price.
- **Fix:** Add callout boxes with rollup formulas for key metrics

### 5. No Social Proof
- **Issue:** Email copy mentions testimonials from "Sarah," "Marcus," "Priya" but these don't exist
- **Impact:** Looks like fake social proof, damages credibility
- **Fix:** Remove testimonials OR get real customer feedback before launch
