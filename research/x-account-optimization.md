## 1. Profile Optimization

### Bio (160 chars)
- **Who you are** + **what you tweet about** (2-3 topics) + **credibility hook**
- Include 1-2 searchable keywords (e.g., "AI agents", "Notion", "productivity")
- Add a CTA link (Linktree, website, newsletter signup)
- Example: `Building AI agents for Notion productivity | Creator of ClawdBot | Tips on AI tools, automation & templates`

### Avatar
- High-contrast, recognizable at small sizes
- For personal brands: well-lit headshot, no sunglasses, face visible
- For product brands: clean logo that reads at 48px

### Banner/Header (1500x500)
- Reinforce your niche visually — tagline, product screenshots, or speaking photo
- Include brand colors and a value proposition
- Update quarterly

### Pinned Tweet
- **THE deciding factor** for profile-to-follow conversion
- Best options: high-performing thread, intro thread ("who I am"), or case study with real numbers
- Rotate every 30-60 days
- Should showcase your best work and give immediate value

### Other
- Keep account **public** (private accounts don't grow)
- Fill in location, website, and birthday fields for algorithm trust signals
- Use a consistent display name (real name or brand name, not handles)

## 2. Posting Frequency & Timing

### Volume
- **4-10 tweets per day** (including replies and quote tweets)
- Accounts posting consistently see **2.5x more impressions**
- Quality > quantity, but volume matters — perfectionism kills growth
- At minimum: 1 original tweet + several replies daily

### Timing (US/general audience)
- **Peak hours:** 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM (audience's local time)
- **Best days:** Tuesday through Thursday for B2B/tech
- Weekends: lower competition = potential for organic reach on evergreen content
- Use X Analytics to find YOUR audience's active hours

### Content Calendar (Sample Week)
| Day | Content Type |
|-----|-------------|
| Mon | Long thread (framework/strategy) |
| Tue | Quick tip + screenshot |
| Wed | Meme or lighter niche-relevant post |
| Thu | Actionable tip or observation |
| Fri | Personal story or case study |
| Daily | Replies, quote tweets, engagement |

## 3. Engagement Tactics

### The First Hour Is Everything
- The algorithm measures **engagement velocity** — likes, replies, retweets in the first 60 minutes
- Rapid early engagement can boost visibility **10x**
- Post when your audience is online, then stay active to reply

### Reply Strategy (Most Important for New Accounts)
- Reply to **bigger accounts** in your niche with thoughtful, value-adding comments
- Aim for **10+ meaningful replies per day**
- Don't just say "great post" — add insight, a counterpoint, or a relevant example
- This is the #1 growth tactic for accounts under 1,000 followers

### Quote Tweets
- Add your own take/insight when retweeting — pure retweets give you nothing
- Quote tweets with strong opinions or additional context get algorithm boost

### Threads
- One of the **most powerful growth formats** in 2025-2026
- Structure: Bold hook → Step-by-step value (6-15 tweets) → Strong CTA
- Example hook: "I studied 100 viral tweets. Here's what I learned 👇"
- End with: "Follow me for more [topic] tips"

### Polls
- Spark engagement and learn what your audience wants
- Algorithm treats poll votes as engagement signals

### Spaces & Communities
- Join and participate in Twitter Spaces in your niche
- Join relevant X Communities (AI, productivity, Notion, etc.)
- Hosting a Space = massive visibility boost

## 4. Hashtag Strategy

### 2025-2026 Reality
- Hashtags are **less important** than they were pre-2023
- The algorithm now relies more on **content relevance and engagement** than hashtag discovery
- Use **1-2 relevant hashtags max** — more looks spammy
- Better in bio than in every tweet
- Useful hashtags for our niche: `#AI`, `#AIagents`, `#Notion`, `#Productivity`, `#BuildInPublic`, `#IndieHacker`

### Alternative Discovery
- X's search engine indexes tweet text — use natural keywords instead of hashtags
- The "For You" algorithm surfaces content based on topic clusters, not hashtags

## 5. Following Strategy for Building Legitimacy

### Who to Follow (for a new account)
1. **Peers** — accounts at similar size building similar things (mutual engagement)
2. **Aspirational accounts** — bigger creators in your niche (reply to them regularly)
3. **Industry accounts** — official brand accounts (Anthropic, Notion, etc.)
4. **Curators/newsletters** — they might share your content
5. **Active engagers** — people who reply/retweet a lot in your niche

### Following Ratio
- Keep follow/follower ratio reasonable — don't follow 5,000 with 50 followers
- Early stage: follow 100-300 highly relevant accounts
- Unfollow non-engagers after 30 days if needed
- Goal: build a **curated feed** that keeps you in the conversation

### Engagement-First Following
- Don't just follow — **engage with their content** before and after following
- Like, reply, quote tweet their best posts
- Build genuine relationships, not transactional follows

## 6. Algorithm Tips (2025-2026)

### What the Algorithm Rewards
1. **Bookmarks** — strongest signal; a bookmarked tweet = high-quality content
2. **Replies** — especially long, threaded conversations
3. **Engagement velocity** — first-hour performance is critical
4. **Dwell time** — how long people pause on your tweet (images, threads, long-form)
5. **Consistency** — posting daily builds topic authority
6. **Media** — tweets with images/video get 2-3x more engagement
7. **Profile completeness** — filled-out profiles get algorithmic trust

### What the Algorithm Penalizes
- External links in tweets (add links in replies instead)
- Excessive hashtags (>3)
- Engagement bait without substance
- Inconsistent posting (going dormant then flooding)
- Buying followers/engagement (destroys reach)

### Pro Tips
- **Put links in the first reply**, not the main tweet — avoids link penalty
- Use **alt text on images** — boosts accessibility AND search discovery
- **Thread your own tweets** to keep conversations going on your posts
- Write like you talk — avoid corporate jargon
- Use the **80/20 rule**: 80% value/entertainment, 20% self-promotion
- **Visual tweets** (screenshots, charts, carousels) significantly outperform text-only
- Ask questions to drive replies (algorithm sees this as conversation)
