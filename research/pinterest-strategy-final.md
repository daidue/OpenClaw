---

## 3. Pin Design Best Practices

### Committed Brand System *(Tightened for consistency)*

**Every pin MUST include:**
- Brand color block (navy or coral) — at least 20% of pin area
- "Jeff the Notion Guy" wordmark — bottom left or right, 18-22pt
- Montserrat Bold for headlines, Open Sans for body
- URL display: "jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com" at bottom

### Optimal Dimensions
- **Standard (80% of pins):** 1000 x 1500 px (2:3)
- **Video:** 1000 x 1500 px, 6-15 seconds, MP4, captions always
- **Carousel:** Up to 5 images, same dimensions

### Text Overlay Rules
- 30-40% text, 60-70% imagery
- Headline: 5-8 words, 60-80pt Montserrat Bold
- CTA: Bottom 1/4 of pin, contrasting color
- Mobile-first: Preview at phone size before publishing

### Accessibility Standards *(NEW)*
- Text contrast: minimum 4.5:1 ratio (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- No critical info in text smaller than 24pt
- Alt text on every pin (keyword-rich description)

### High-Converting Pin Formats

1. **Product Mockup** — Template on laptop, clean background, navy/coral palette
2. **Before/After** — Chaos (red/gray) → Organized (green/blue) split screen
3. **Feature List** — Checkmark list on navy background, white text, coral accents
4. **Social Proof** — Testimonial quote + star rating + template screenshot
5. **Tutorial Teaser** — 3-step preview, numbered, progressive color

### CTA Wording

| Product | CTA |
|---------|-----|
| Free Template | "Get it FREE →" / "Download Now" |
| Paid Template | "Shop the Template →" / "Only $27 → Instant Access" |
| Educational | "Save for Later" / "Read the Tutorial →" |

## 4. Pinterest → Etsy Traffic Strategy *(NEW — Expert Panel Addition)*

### Dual-Destination Pin Strategy

**Alternate pin destinations:**
- 50% of product pins → Gumroad
- 30% of product pins → Etsy listing
- 20% of product pins → Landing page (captures email, links to both)

### Etsy's Native Pinterest Integration
- Use Etsy's "Share to Pinterest" on every listing
- Etsy auto-generates pins with product info — customize before sharing
- Etsy Rich Pins pull directly from listing data

### Pinterest → Etsy Attribution
```
Etsy links from pins: etsy.com/listing/[ID]?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=pin&utm_campaign=toolkit
```
Track in Etsy Stats → Traffic → External to see Pinterest referrals

### Why Both Destinations?
- Gumroad: Higher margins (no marketplace fees beyond payment processing)
- Etsy: Higher trust for new buyers, review system, built-in audience
- Test which converts better from Pinterest traffic → double down
