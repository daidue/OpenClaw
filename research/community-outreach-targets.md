## Outreach Strategy

1. **Week 1:** Join all communities. Observe rules. Engage genuinely (comment, help others).
2. **Week 2:** Share free Lite template in communities that allow it. Use "I built this free tool" framing.
3. **Week 3:** Follow up on engagement. Answer questions. Build reputation.
4. **Ongoing:** Rotate posts, share updates, engage with feedback.

### Post Template (adapt per community)
> I built a free Notion invoice tracker for freelancers — tracks clients, projects, invoices, and payment status all in one dashboard. No sign-up, just duplicate and use.
>
> [Link to free template]
>
> Would love feedback from anyone who tries it!

### Key Rules
- **Always lead with the FREE version** — never pitch the paid one directly
- **Engage before promoting** — be a member first, promoter second
- **Adapt the framing** — "student freelancers" for student groups, "business tool" for business groups
- **Screenshot game matters** — clean, compelling screenshots get clicks
