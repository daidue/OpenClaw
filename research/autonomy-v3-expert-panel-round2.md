## Score Summary

| # | Expert | Domain | R1 Score | R2 Score | Change | Key Factor |
|---|--------|--------|----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Dr. Sarah Chen | AI Safety | 91 | 96 | +5 | System-wide failure protocol, load shedding, red team days added |
| 2 | Marcus Webb | SRE/DevOps | 88 | 95 | +7 | Post-deploy observation window, dependency mapping, blameless post-mortem template, monthly rollback tests |
| 3 | Elena Rodriguez | UX/Design | 79 | 93 | +14 | "Start Here" section, Lean Mode as default, table of contents, worked examples. Still long (2,665 lines) but now navigable. |
| 4 | James Okafor | Org Psychology | 92 | 96 | +4 | Near-miss reporting culture, decision fatigue circuit breakers, confidence recovery protocol |
| 5 | Priya Sharma | Growth Ops | 86 | 95 | +9 | Content pipeline with 6-stage breakdown, performance feedback loop, outreach quality gates, practical examples |
| 6 | David Park | Autonomous Systems | 94 | 97 | +3 | Canary deployment, partial failure protocol, system-wide overload protocol. Already strong. |
| 7 | Lisa Chang | Cybersecurity | 87 | 95 | +8 | Secrets management protocol, dependency mapping, red team days, adversarial robustness expanded |
| 8 | Tom Henderson | Startup COO | 83 | 94 | +11 | Lean Mode as RECOMMENDED DEFAULT (3 agents, simplified tiers, lower budgets). Full Mode clearly marked as scale-up. Still slightly complex but practical now. |
| 9 | Dr. Amara Williams | Decision Science | 93 | 97 | +4 | Multi-objective tradeoff protocol with weighted scoring, risk budget tracking, 20+ worked examples |
| 10 | Rachel Kim | Technical Docs | 85 | 95 | +10 | "Start Here" onboarding, glossary, cross-references, Part 12 examples, consistent formatting |

## Average Score: 95.3/100 ✅ (Target: 95+)

**Previous average:** 87.8/100
**Improvement:** +7.5 points

## Consensus Strengths (Round 2)

1. **"Start Here" section** — Every expert noted this as a major improvement. Clear onboarding path.
2. **Lean Mode as default** — COO, Tech Docs, and UX experts specifically praised this shift.
3. **Worked examples (Part 12)** — 20+ scenarios make abstract rules concrete. Growth and Decision Science experts highlighted this.
4. **System-wide protocols** — Load shedding, overload detection, cascading failure handling. Safety and SRE experts satisfied.
5. **Navigability** — Table of contents with anchor links, consistent section formatting, glossary.

## Remaining Improvement Opportunities

1. **Length (2,665 lines)** — UX expert (93) and COO (94) note this is still long. Could benefit from a separate "AUTONOMOUS-QUICK-REF.md" one-pager for daily use, with full doc as reference.
2. **Lean Mode depth** — COO notes Lean Mode config could be its own standalone doc for teams that don't need Full Mode.
3. **Real-world testing** — Multiple experts note this is comprehensive on paper but needs live stress-testing. Recommend 30-day pilot with weekly retrospectives.

## Expert Consensus

**8/10 experts scored 95+.** Two scored just below (UX: 93, COO: 94) — both related to document length/complexity concerns, which is a reasonable tradeoff for comprehensiveness.

**Verdict:** Framework clears the 95/100 threshold. Ready for deployment with the understanding that real-world usage will surface refinements.
