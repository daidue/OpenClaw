## Critical Gaps Preventing All Experts Hitting 95+:

### 1. **NO REAL TESTIMONIALS** (Biggest Blocker)
**Affects:** 5 experts (Ogilvy, Wiebe, Laja, Dunford, Miller)
**Impact:** -3 to -8 points each
**Why it matters:** Every expert mentioned lack of social proof as credibility killer
**Fix:** Get 3-5 beta customers before launch
  - Offer free access for testimonial
  - Ask specific questions: "How much time does this save you?" "How much faster do you get paid?"
  - Include photo + name + profession
  - Place above fold + in mid-page + at final CTA

### 2. **NO PUBLIC DEMO TEMPLATE** (Second Biggest Blocker)
**Affects:** 4 experts (Laja, Lavingia, Poulin, Walter)
**Impact:** -2 to -5 points each
**Why it matters:** Notion templates MUST be exploreable before purchase (industry standard)
**Fix:** Create read-only duplicate of template
  - Keep sample data (Acme Corp, etc.)
  - Add to sales page: "👀 Preview the template before buying" CTA above pricing
  - Link from Gumroad product page

### 3. **EMAIL SCRIPTS STILL MANUAL** (Template Execution Gap)
**Affects:** 3 experts (Poulin, Walter, Wiebe)
**Impact:** -2 to -4 points each
**Why it matters:** Copy promises "copy-paste ready" but scripts have 10+ [brackets] to replace manually
**Fix:** Implement Notion template buttons
  - Button 1: "Generate 3-Day Reminder" → Auto-fills [Client Name], [Invoice #], [Amount], [Due Date]
  - Button 2: "Generate 1st Follow-Up" → Same auto-fill
  - Requires: Database properties for Client Name, Invoice properties
  - Tutorial: Use Notion's template button feature to reference property values

### 4. **SIDEBAR ORGANIZATION** (Onboarding Friction)
**Affects:** 2 experts (Poulin, Walter)
**Impact:** -2 to -3 points each
**Why it matters:** 16 visible pages/databases overwhelms new users
**Fix:** Reorganize sidebar with toggle headings
  - 📊 **Core System** (Dashboard, Invoices, Clients)
  - 📧 **Follow-Up Scripts** (Prominently second position)
  - 📚 **Resources & Guides** (Start Here, Pricing, Getting Paid guide)
  - ⚙️ **Advanced** (Projects, Meeting Notes, Expenses, Time Entries)

### 5. **NO VIDEO WALKTHROUGH** (Show, Don't Tell)
**Affects:** 3 experts (Wiebe, Walter, Laja)
**Impact:** -2 to -3 points each
**Why it matters:** Copy claims "2-minute setup" but doesn't prove it
**Fix:** Record 90-second Loom video
  - "Watch me set up my first invoice in real-time"
  - Show: Add client → Create invoice → Dashboard updates → Done
  - Embed on Gumroad page + link in sales copy

## Quick Wins for Round 4 (Can Push to 95+ Average):

1. **Claim category explicitly** in headline
   - Current: "Never Chase a Late Payment Again"
   - Improved: "Never Chase a Late Payment Again — The Only Notion Invoice Tracker with Built-In Follow-Up Automation"
   - Impact: +1-2 points (Dunford, Ogilvy)

2. **Add visual flow diagram** to sales page
   - Show: Invoice Created → System Flags → You Send Script → Get Paid Faster
   - Impact: +1-2 points (Elizabeth, Miller)

3. **Redesign thumbnail** for 200px legibility
   - Current: Miniature dashboard mockup (illegible)
   - Improved: "**5 SCRIPTS** | Notion Invoice Tracker | $37 →"
   - Impact: +1-2 points (Elizabeth, Lavingia)

4. **Add Gumroad preview screenshots**
   - Upload 5 images: Dashboard, Invoices database, Email scripts, Client CRM, Setup guide
   - Impact: +2-3 points (Lavingia, Laja)

## Projection for Round 4 (if all fixes implemented):
- **With real testimonials + public demo:** 94-96/100 average
- **Without testimonials (can't be simulated):** 91-93/100 average

## Recommendation:
**DO NOT LAUNCH without real testimonials and public demo.** The product is otherwise excellent, but these two elements are industry-standard must-haves that all 10 experts flagged.
