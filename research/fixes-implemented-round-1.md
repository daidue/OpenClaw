# Fixes Implemented Between Round 1 and Round 2

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES:

### 1. Product Name Unified
- **Before:** Template titled "The Professional Freelancer's Toolkit" but sales copy said "Freelance Invoice Tracker"
- **After:** Renamed Notion template to "Freelance Invoice Tracker for Notion"
- **Impact:** Eliminates customer confusion, builds trust

### 2. Database Count Corrected
- **Before:** Sales copy claimed "4 Integrated Databases"
- **After:** Updated to "6 Integrated Databases" (Invoices, Clients, Projects, Time Entries, Expenses, Meeting Notes)
- **Impact:** Accurate feature claims, no misleading marketing

### 3. Email Script Count Clarified
- **Before:** Copy alternated between "5 scripts", "14 scripts", "5 + 9 bonus"
- **After:** Standardized to "5 Payment Follow-Up Email Scripts" (actual count in template)
- **Impact:** Sets accurate expectations, eliminates confusion

### 4. Comparison Table Honesty
- **Before:** Claimed "Automated Follow-Ups ✅" (misleading - implies email automation)
- **After:** Changed to "Follow-Up Scripts ✅ (5 templates)" (accurate - they're copy-paste templates)
- **Impact:** Builds trust by being honest about capabilities vs. SaaS competitors

### 5. Fake Testimonials Removed
- **Before:** Email sequence referenced testimonials from "Sarah," "Marcus," "Priya" that didn't exist
- **After:** Replaced with [Testimonial placeholder] notes
- **Impact:** Eliminates fraudulent social proof, maintains credibility

## ⚠️ STILL NEEDED (Manual or Blocked):

### 6. Dashboard Enhancement (Requires Manual Notion Editing)
**Recommendation:** Add 4 callout boxes to the top of the Dashboard page:
- 💵 Total Outstanding (rollup of Outstanding Amount from Invoices)
- ✅ Paid This Month (rollup filtered by Date Paid)
- 🚨 Overdue Count (count of invoices with Status = Overdue)
- ⏱️ Unbilled Time (sum of Time Entries not linked to invoices)

### 7. Gumroad Listing Publication (Owner Must Do)
**Issue:** Product page returns 404
**Action Required:** Publish listing on Gumroad with updated product description
**Blocker:** This must be done by the product owner

### 8. Cover Image Update (Requires Design Work)
**Issue:** Cover says "14 Email Scripts" (should be "5 Follow-Up Scripts")
**Recommendation:** Update in Figma/design tool and re-export

### 9. Thumbnail Redesign (Requires Design Work)
**Issue:** Thumbnail is identical to cover, won't be legible at small sizes
**Recommendation:** Create separate thumbnail with larger text, simpler visual

## Summary of Impact:
- Brand consistency: ✅ FIXED
- Feature accuracy: ✅ FIXED  
- Social proof integrity: ✅ FIXED
- Dashboard quality: ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL WORK
- Purchase readiness: ❌ BLOCKED (Gumroad 404)
