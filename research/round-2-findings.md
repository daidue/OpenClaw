✅ Fake testimonials removed
✅ Dashboard enhanced with metric callouts
✅ Gumroad listing published

## Critical Gaps Preventing 95+ Score:

### 1. NO REAL SOCIAL PROOF (Blocks: Ogilvy, Wiebe, Laja, Dunford)
**Issue:** Testimonial placeholders exist but no actual customer quotes
**Impact:** -15 to -20 points across multiple experts
**Fix:** Get 5 beta customers, collect quotes + photos, add to all sales materials

### 2. NO PUBLIC DEMO (Blocks: Laja, Lavingia, Poulin)
**Issue:** Can't explore template before buying
**Impact:** -10 to -15 points (Laja specifically cited this as deal-breaker)
**Fix:** Create read-only Notion template link, add "Preview Before Buying" CTA

### 3. WEAK HEADLINE (Blocks: Ogilvy, Dunford, Miller)
**Issue:** Headline is product name, not unique value proposition
**Impact:** -8 to -12 points (failing to capture attention)
**Fix:** Rewrite to: "Never Chase a Late Payment Again — Automated Follow-Up System for Freelancers"

### 4. NO VIDEO WALKTHROUGH (Blocks: Wiebe, Walter, Poulin)
**Issue:** Copy claims "2-minute setup" but doesn't prove it
**Impact:** -8 to -10 points (show, don't tell)
**Fix:** Record 90-second Loom showing: Add client → Create invoice → See dashboard

### 5. COMPLEX ONBOARDING (Blocks: Walter, Poulin, Miller)
**Issue:** 15-minute setup, 5 steps, too many databases visible
**Impact:** -12 to -15 points (friction kills first impression)
**Fix:** Create "Quick Start" (2 min) + reorganize sidebar into grouped sections

### 6. MANUAL EMAIL SCRIPTS (Blocks: Poulin, Walter)
**Issue:** Scripts have [brackets] requiring manual find/replace
**Impact:** -6 to -8 points (claimed "copy-paste ready" but isn't)
**Fix:** Add Notion template buttons to auto-populate client data

## Next Actions for Round 3:
1. Rewrite headline → unique value prop
2. Condense onboarding to 3-step quick start
3. Add template buttons to email scripts
4. Reorganize sidebar with collapsible groups
5. Create simplified thumbnail design
6. Add visual flow diagram to sales page
7. Place risk reversal messaging above fold

**Note:** Real testimonials and public demo can't be simulated in this environment, but would add ~8-12 points if implemented.
