## 3. REDDIT LAUNCH PLAYBOOK: SUCCESSFUL NOTION TEMPLATE LAUNCHES

### **Overview:**
Reddit is HIGHLY allergic to self-promotion. Value-first, community-minded posts work. Direct sales pitches get downvoted or banned.

---

### **EXAMPLE 1: Freelancer Productivity Dashboard Launch**
**Subreddit:** r/Notion  
**Strategy:** 24-Hour FREE Giveaway for First 100 People  
**Post Title:** "Freelancer Productivity Dashboard - My First Notion Template!"

**What They Did Right:**
1. **Value First:** Made it FREE for 24 hours to build goodwill
2. **Limited Scarcity:** "First 100 people" creates urgency without being salesy
3. **Celebratory Framing:** "To celebrate the launch..." (not "buy my thing")
4. **Community Feedback Request:** Asked for opinions, made it conversational
5. **Timing:** Posted early morning US time (7-9am EST) for maximum visibility
6. **Visual Content:** Included screenshot preview in post

**Results Pattern:**
- High engagement, positive comments
- Email list building through Gumroad's "pay what you want" ($0 option)
- Converts free users to paid products later

---

### **EXAMPLE 2: "I Made $250,000 Selling Notion Templates" (AMA)**
**Subreddit:** r/Notion  
**Creator:** carlpadonosk  
**Post Type:** Ask Me Anything (AMA)

**What Made It Work:**
1. **Credibility Hook:** Led with impressive revenue figure (backed by proof)
2. **Educational Format:** Not selling, teaching others how to succeed
3. **Transparency:** Answered questions about process, failures, lessons learned
4. **Community Value:** Positioned as mentor, not seller
5. **No Direct Links:** Didn't promote own products in main post (against rules)
6. **Timing:** Strategic AMA during high-traffic hours

**Key Insight:** Build authority first, sales follow naturally. People DM'd to ask about products.

---

### **EXAMPLE 3: "Free Notion Template for Freelancers!"**
**Subreddit:** r/Notion, r/freelance  
**Hook:** "I built a simple and clean 'Freelance OS – Lite' template"

**Formula:**
1. **Free Lead Magnet:** Gave away simplified version
2. **Clear Benefit Bullets:**
   - ✅ Track clients in one place
   - ✅ Organize tasks with deadlines
   - ✅ Record invoices and payments
3. **Target Audience Called Out:** "Perfect for writers, designers, developers, and side hustlers"
4. **Humble Tone:** "I built this" vs "Check out my product"
5. **Comment Engagement:** Creator responded to every comment within first hour
6. **Soft Upsell:** Mentioned paid version exists but didn't push it

**Subreddits Used:**
- r/Notion (primary)
- r/freelance
- r/SideProject
- r/Productivity
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong

---

### **EXAMPLE 4: Product Hunt Launch → Reddit Amplification**
**Strategy:** Launch on Product Hunt first, then share PH link on Reddit

**Why This Works:**
- Reddit allows "sharing cool things I found" better than direct self-promo
- Product Hunt provides social proof (upvotes, comments)
- Can frame as "my template is on Product Hunt today" which feels less salesy
- Gets 2x launch day traffic spike

**Best Subreddits for Product Hunt Shares:**
- r/ProductHunted
- r/SideProject
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/startups (if it's business-focused)

---

### **EXAMPLE 5: The "Made My Paid Templates FREE" Strategy**
**Subreddit:** r/Notion  
**Post:** "Last 2 days have been CRAZY! I made my paid templates FREE because they were getting dust, now I got hundreds of downloads."

**Why It Worked:**
1. **Vulnerability:** Admitted products weren't selling (relatable)
2. **Generosity:** Gave away value for free = massive goodwill
3. **FOMO:** Time-limited free offer
4. **Story Arc:** Struggled → pivoted → winning (people love this)
5. **No Ask:** Didn't ask for anything in return

**Result:** Hundreds of downloads → email list growth → future paid product sales

---

## REDDIT LAUNCH PLAYBOOK SUMMARY

### **DO's:**
✅ **Lead with value:** Free templates, guides, tutorials  
✅ **Use educational framing:** "How I built..." or "Lessons from..."  
✅ **Include visuals:** Screenshots, GIFs, before/after comparisons  
✅ **Engage authentically:** Reply to every comment in first 2 hours  
✅ **Post during peak hours:** 7-9am EST or 5-7pm EST on weekdays  
✅ **Target specific subreddits:** r/Notion, r/freelance, r/productivity, r/SideProject  
✅ **Use humble, conversational tone:** "I made this..." not "Buy this..."  
✅ **Offer free version first:** Build trust, collect emails, upsell later  
✅ **Soft launch strategy:** "Would love feedback" vs "Check out my store"  
✅ **Cross-post strategically:** Wait 24-48 hours between subreddits to avoid spam detection  

### **DON'Ts:**
❌ **Direct sales pitches:** "Buy my template" gets downvoted/removed  
❌ **Spamming multiple subs at once:** Reddit's spam filters will shadowban  
❌ **Asking for upvotes:** Against Reddit rules  
❌ **Ignoring comments:** Low engagement = low visibility  
❌ **Posting during dead hours:** 2-5am EST = wasted post  
❌ **Using brand/store names in title:** Too salesy  
❌ **Posting only links:** Add context and story in text body  
❌ **Reposting same content:** Use different angles for each subreddit
