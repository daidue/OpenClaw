# Pricing Strategy for Digital Products

## Core Principle: Price for Your Audience Size

| Audience Size | Recommended Price | Why |
|--------------|------------------|-----|
| 0 followers | $9-19 | Cold traffic, no trust |
| < 1K followers | $19-27 | Some trust, needs social proof |
| 1K-10K followers | $27-49 | Warm audience, can price higher |
| 10K+ followers | $49-130+ | Brand loyalty, premium positioning |

**Key insight:** $37+ works for influencers. For strangers with zero trust, $19-27 is the sweet spot for first 100 sales. Raise prices AFTER you have testimonials and social proof.

## The Free Tier Funnel

### Structure

```
Free Lead Magnet (PWYW $0+)
    ↓ 100 downloads
    ↓ 8-12% convert
Paid Product ($19-27)
    ↓ Future: bundle or premium tier
Premium / Bundle ($47-79)
```

### Free Tier Design Rules
1. **Solve ONE specific pain point** completely (not a crippled version)
2. **Include real value** — users should genuinely benefit from free version
3. **Show the gap** — make clear what paid version adds (comparison table)
4. **Capture email** — every free download = email address
5. **Count toward platform thresholds** — 10 PWYW = Gumroad Discover unlock

### Upsell Math

| Free Downloads | Conversion Rate | Paid Price | Revenue |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| 50 | 8% | $27 | $108 |
| 100 | 8% | $27 | $216 |
| 200 | 10% | $27 | $540 |
| 500 | 10% | $27 | $1,350 |
| 1,000 | 12% | $27 | $3,240 |

Conversion rate improves over time as you add testimonials, refine upsell emails, and build trust.

## Pricing Tiers Pattern

### Option A: Two-Tier (Simplest)
- **Free/Lite:** Core feature only (email capture)
- **Full:** Complete system ($19-27)

### Option B: Three-Tier (Good/Better/Best)
- **Free/Lite:** Core feature ($0)
- **Standard:** Full system ($27)
- **Pro/Bundle:** Full + extras + future products ($47-79)

### Option C: Launch Pricing
- **Early Bird:** 30% off for first 50 buyers → creates urgency
- **Regular:** Standard price after threshold
- **Never discount more than 50%** — trains customers to wait for sales

## Price Anchoring Techniques

1. **Show monthly SaaS costs vs one-time:** "FreshBooks = $17/mo ($204/yr). This template = $27 once."
2. **Per-feature math:** "$27 for 6 databases = $4.50 each"
3. **ROI framing:** "Pays for itself after one recovered late payment"
4. **Time savings:** "$27 ÷ 5 hours saved/week = $0.10/hour"
5. **Bundle anchor:** Show $79 bundle next to $27 standard (makes standard feel cheap)

## Revenue Projections (Zero Audience Start)

### Conservative Path
| Month | Free Downloads | Paid Sales | Revenue |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 100 | 8-10 | $216-270 |
| 2 | 200 | 16-20 | $432-540 |
| 3 | 400 | 35-45 | $945-1,215 |
| 6 | 800/mo | 70-90/mo | $1,890-2,430/mo |

### Assumptions
- Gumroad Discover unlocked Month 1 (passive traffic begins)
- Pinterest generating 200+ visitors/mo by Month 3
- Email list growing 100-200/mo
- 2-3 marketplace listings generating passive sales
- Price at $27

### Revenue Levers
1. **More free downloads** → more upsells (distribution problem)
2. **Higher conversion rate** → better upsell emails, testimonials (optimization problem)
3. **Higher price** → only after social proof justifies it (trust problem)
4. **Second product** → bundle upsell to existing customers (product problem)
5. **Affiliate program** → others sell for you at 50/50 split (scale problem)

## Platform Fee Impact on Margins

At $27 product price:

| Platform | Fee | Your Take |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Notion Gallery | $0 | $27.00 |
| Lemon Squeezy | ~$1.85 | $25.15 |
| Gumroad | ~$3.20 | $23.80 |
| Etsy | ~$3.00 | $24.00 |
| NotionEverything | $5.40 (20%) | $21.60 |
| Prototion | $5.40 (20%) | $21.60 |
| Creative Market | $13.50 (50%) | $13.50 ❌ |

**Strategy:** Use marketplace commissions as customer acquisition cost. Even at 20%, you're getting sales you wouldn't have gotten otherwise. Focus on building email list from marketplace customers for future direct sales.

## When to Raise Prices

Raise price when you have:
- [ ] 20+ sales with no price complaints
- [ ] 3+ genuine testimonials
- [ ] Consistent organic traffic (not just launch spike)
- [ ] Comparison products priced higher
- [ ] Feature additions that justify increase

**How to raise:** Announce "price going up on [date]" → captures fence-sitters → raise $5-10 at a time.
