## Channel-by-Channel Strategies

## Reddit

### Timeline: Month 2+ (NOT Week 1)

Reddit requires 30+ days of karma building before any promotion. New accounts dropping links get banned.

### Rules by Subreddit
- **r/freelance:** Self-promo in weekly thread only
- **r/Notion:** No template links in posts (profile only)
- **r/smallbusiness:** Self-Promo Saturdays only
- **r/Entrepreneur:** Strict self-promo rules
- **r/SideProject:** More lenient, maker stories welcome

### Post Formula
**Title options:**
- "I built a [thing] for [audience] — would love feedback!"
- "Free [thing] to help [solve specific problem]"
- "Spent [X hours] building this — giving it away free"

**Structure:**
1. **Hook (1-2 sentences):** Personal story or problem solved — lead with pain, not features
2. **What it does (3-5 bullets):** Benefits with emojis
3. **Who it's for:** Specific audience
4. **CTA:** "Link in comments" or "DM me"
5. **Engagement question:** "What features would you add?"

### Critical Rules
- ✅ Lead with value (free resources, guides, tutorials)
- ✅ Use educational framing ("How I built..." or "Lessons from...")
- ✅ Reply to every comment within 2 hours
- ✅ Wait 24-48 hours between cross-posts
- ✅ Post 7-9am EST or 5-7pm EST on Tue/Wed/Thu
- ❌ Never direct sales pitch
- ❌ Never spam multiple subs simultaneously
- ❌ Never use brand names in title
- ❌ Never post weekends (lower engagement)

### Engagement Strategy
When someone asks "can I see it?" → share link in reply (not the post).
When someone shares their approach → "That's a great setup!" (participate, don't compete).
Budget 6+ hours engagement per post for best results.

### Proof Points to Include
- Usage duration ("used it for 3 months")
- Concrete results ("caught $1,200 in overdue payments")
- Specific numbers ("tracked 23 invoices")
- Sample content ("4 sample entries from my own work")

## X / Twitter

### Thread Formula (Best for Cold Audiences)
1. **Hook tweet:** Specific pain + dollar amount ("Lost $2,400 to forgotten invoices")
2. **Story tweets (2-3):** How you solved it
3. **Product tweet:** What you built + link
4. **Proof tweet:** Concrete results
5. **Self-reply:** Screenshot of product in action (boosts thread visibility)

### Single Post Rotation
- **Version 1 (Cold):** Pain-first → solution → link
- **Version 2 (Warm):** Feature list for reposting
- **Version 3 (Post-traction):** Community-focused, "X people are using this"
- **Version 4 (Retargeting):** Results-first ("caught $X in payments")

### Best Practices
- 1 hashtag max per tweet (naturally integrated)
- Reply to every comment within 2 hours
- Self-reply with screenshot within 5 minutes of posting
- Rotate versions over days (don't repeat same post)

## Discord / Slack Communities

### Approach
1. **Join 3-5 relevant communities** (freelance, productivity, niche)
2. **Engage for 3-5 days minimum** before sharing anything
3. **Check channel rules** and search for recent similar shares
4. **Post in appropriate channel** (#resources, #share, #self-promo)

### Post Structure
```
Last month I realized I'd lost track of $X in [problem]...

So I built [thing] to fix it. It's free:

→ [Feature 1]
→ [Feature 2]  
→ [Feature 3]

I've used it for [duration] and [concrete result].

Link: [url]

Happy to answer questions or take feedback 🙏
```

### Follow-Up (2 Weeks Later)
Circle back with results: "That [thing] I shared got [X downloads]. Thanks to @person1 and @person2 for the feedback — I added [improvement] based on your suggestions."

## Pinterest (Underrated Power Channel)

### Why Pinterest Works for Digital Products
- Users search with **purchase intent** (it's a search engine, not social media)
- Pins last 3-6 months (vs Reddit posts: 48 hours)
- **No follower requirement** — algorithm surfaces by keywords
- Visual products are native to the platform

### Real Case Study
- $0/mo → $1,420/mo in 6 months
- 2,800 monthly visitors, 2.3% conversion
- Time: 3 hours/month after initial setup

### Setup (3 Hours)
1. Create Pinterest Business account (free)
2. Sign up for Tailwind ($12.99/mo or free trial)
3. Design 10-30 pin templates in Canva (product mockups)
4. Schedule 10-15 pins/day via Tailwind SmartSchedule
5. Target keywords in pin titles + descriptions + board names

### Pin Optimization
- **Title:** "[Product Type] | [Benefit] | [Audience]"
- **Description:** Include target keywords naturally, 2-3 sentences
- **Board names:** Keyword-rich ("Notion Templates for Freelancers")
- **Pin design:** Mockups of product in use, clean visual style

## DM Outreach (Fastest to First 10)

### Who to DM
- 5-10 freelancer friends/contacts
- Discord/Slack community members you've interacted with
- LinkedIn connections in target audience
- Twitter followers who engage with similar content

### Message Template (Personalize Each One)
```
Hey [Name]! Quick favor — I just launched a free [product] 
on Gumroad and I'm trying to get my first 10 downloads. 

Would you mind grabbing it? It's genuinely free ($0, no catch), 
and it's actually useful if you [specific use case]. Takes 10 seconds: [link]

Specifically curious if [specific feature] feels [natural/useful/etc].

Would really appreciate it 🙏
```

### Follow-Up (2 Weeks)
```
Hey [Name]! Quick update — that [product] you helped me test 
got [X downloads]. Your feedback about [specific thing] was 
super helpful. [What you changed]. Thanks again!
```

### Rules
- Send max 5/day (don't be spammy)
- Personalize every message (reference recent conversation)
- Include specific feedback prompt (not just "what do you think?")
- Never send to strangers cold — must have existing relationship
- Goal: 2-3 relationships strengthened, not just downloads

## Medium / Dev.to / Hashnode (Content SEO)

### Article Formula
**Title:** "How I [solved problem] with [approach] (Free [Product] Inside)"
**Example:** "How I Stopped Losing $3K/Year to Messy Freelance Invoicing"

**Structure:**
1. Personal story + pain point (200 words)
2. What you tried that didn't work (100 words)
3. Your solution + how it works (300 words)
4. Results (100 words)
5. CTA: "Grab it free → [link]" (50 words)

### Why This Works
- ONE article can drive first sales in 48-72 hours
- Each platform = a backlink (SEO value)
- Evergreen content continues driving traffic for months
- Cross-post to all 3 platforms (each has different audience)

---

## Facebook Groups (Overlooked)

- Groups like "Freelance Graphic Designers" (50K members) allow promo 1x/week
- Older demographic = higher willingness to pay
- Less saturated than Reddit
- Join 5-10 groups → engage 2 weeks → share free version
