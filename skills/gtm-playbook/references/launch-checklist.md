3. Pivot messaging or pricing
4. Ask 5 target customers why they wouldn't buy

### "Marketplace rejection"
1. Email asking for specific feedback
2. Address feedback, resubmit in 2 weeks
3. Focus on other marketplaces meanwhile

### "Negative feedback"
1. Thank the person publicly
2. Fix the issue immediately
3. Post update showing you listened
4. Turn critic into advocate
