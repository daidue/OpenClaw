# Gumroad Strategy & Platform Comparison

## Gumroad Discover Unlock Strategy

Discover is Gumroad's built-in marketplace. Products with 10+ sales get featured → organic traffic (500-2,000 impressions/month for new products). **This is Priority #1A for any Gumroad launch.**

### How to Hit 10 Sales Fast

1. **Launch free/lite version as PWYW ($0+ minimum, NO suggested price)** — removes friction
2. Each $0 download counts as a transaction toward Discover threshold
3. Share in 3-5 places Day 1 (communities, DMs, social)
4. **Target: 10 transactions in 48-72 hours**

### PWYW Best Practices
- Set minimum to $0, remove suggested price (every extra decision = fewer transactions)
- Some people voluntarily pay $1-5 — bonus revenue, don't optimize for it
- PWYW downloads capture email addresses for upsell sequence
- List free version as SEPARATE Gumroad product (doubles Discover presence)

### Listing Optimization

**Title formula:** `[Product Name] — [Primary Benefit] | [Secondary Keywords]`
Example: "Professional Freelancer's Toolkit for Notion – Invoice, Track Time, Get Paid Faster"

**Description structure:**
1. Pain point (specific, visceral — "weekend lost to receipt archaeology")
2. "Imagine this instead" (aspirational state)
3. What's included (benefit-driven features with emojis)
4. Comparison table (Free vs Lite vs Full)
5. Who it's for / who it's NOT for
6. FAQ (addresses objections)
7. Post-purchase sequence preview
8. Two CTAs (try free vs buy now)

**SEO elements:**
- Front-load primary keywords in title
- Natural keyword integration in first 160 characters (meta preview)
- Include target personas by name ("freelancers, consultants, designers")

### Gumroad Email Workflows
- **Post-download (Day 0):** Delivery + quick start
- **Day 2-3:** "How's it working? Here's what you're missing..." (upsell)
- **Day 7:** Feature spotlight + upgrade CTA
- **Day 14:** Social proof + limited offer

### Upsell Conversion Math
- Expected conversion: 5-10% of free downloaders → paid
- At 100 free downloads × 8% × $27 = $216
- At 500 free downloads × 8% × $27 = $1,080
