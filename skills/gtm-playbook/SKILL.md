# GTM Playbook — Digital Product Launch

Reusable go-to-market framework for launching digital products from zero audience to sustainable revenue. Distilled from real launches, expert panels, and validated strategies.

## Quick Start

1. **Pick 3 channels max** for first 60 days — spreading thin kills launches
2. **Ship before perfect** — 90% ready beats 100% never-launched
3. **Commit to 90 days** — most creators quit at day 10 with 2-3 sales

## Launch Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Launch (2-3 days)
- Finalize free/lite lead magnet version
- Record 2-min walkthrough video (Loom)
- Build email capture page (Carrd $19/yr or free alternative)
- Create 10 visual pins/graphics (Canva)
- Write 1 long-form article (Medium/Dev.to/Hashnode)
- Prepare marketplace submissions

### Phase 1: Launch Week (Days 1-7)
- Submit to ALL marketplaces Day 1 (see `references/marketplace-submissions.md`)
- Set up primary distribution channel (see `references/content-distribution.md`)
- Publish listings with optimized copy (see `references/gumroad-strategy.md`)
- Direct outreach to 15-20 people
- Engage every comment/reply within 2 hours
- **Goal:** 50 free downloads, 3-5 paid sales

### Phase 2: Amplify (Days 8-14)
- Email free users with upgrade offer
- Post update/learnings on communities
- Optimize based on analytics
- Add testimonials from first customers
- **Goal:** 10+ paid sales, unlock platform discovery features

### Phase 3: Scale (Weeks 3-8)
- Expand to 2nd/3rd distribution channels
- Launch Reddit strategy (after 30 days karma building)
- First email nurture sequence
- Iterate based on customer feedback
- **Goal:** $500/month by Day 60

### Phase 4: Optimize (Months 3-6)
- SEO landing page (if revenue justifies it)
- Second product (bundle upsell)
- Video content (if budget allows)
- **Goal:** $1,000-1,500/month by Month 6

## Channel Selection Guide

| Channel | Speed to Sales | Effort | Best For |
|---------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Platform Marketplace (Notion Gallery, etc.) | Fast (if approved) | Low | Built-in buyer traffic |
| Gumroad Discover | Fast (after 10 sales) | Low | Passive discovery |
| Pinterest + Tailwind | Medium (30 days) | Low ongoing | Visual products, evergreen |
| Email capture + free tier | Fast | Medium | Highest conversion (8-12%) |
| Reddit | Slow (needs 30 days karma) | High | Authority building |
| X/Twitter | Variable | Medium | Audience building |
| DM Outreach | Fastest | High | First 10 sales |
| Etsy | Medium | Low | Commodity products |
| SEO | Very slow (6-12 months) | High | Long-term passive |
| Product Hunt | ❌ Broken for templates | — | Skip unless software |

## Key Principles (from Expert Panels)

1. **Marketplaces with built-in buyers are Tier 1** — not social media
2. **Email capture is Day 1** — every touchpoint should collect an email
3. **Price for cold traffic** — strangers won't pay influencer prices; $19-27 sweet spot for first 100 sales
4. **Lead with pain, not features** — "I lost $X to [problem]" beats "Here's my template"
5. **10 transactions unlock Gumroad Discover** — even $0 PWYW counts
6. **Pinterest is massively underrated** — real case study: $0→$1,400/mo in 6 months, zero followers
7. **Product Hunt is dead for templates** — stopped featuring them early 2024
8. **Reddit requires 30+ days karma** — never launch there in Week 1
9. **Video walkthroughs convert** — "show me it working" beats any copy
10. **90-day commitment minimum** — the "trough of despair" hits at Week 2
