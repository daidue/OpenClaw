# X Reply Strategy Playbook

Build authentic authority through strategic, value-adding replies.

## Core Strategy

- **Volume:** 40-50 replies/day across tiered target accounts
- **Timing:** 2-3 min delay post-publication (human-like, not bot-like)
- **Value-first:** Add insights, share experiences, ask smart questions
- **Peak windows:** 9-11 AM ET, 1-2 PM ET, 8-10 PM ET

## Daily Reply Allocation

| Tier | Focus | Replies/Day |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | AI Agents & ecosystem | 15 (30%) |
| 2 | Automation & no-code | 10 (20%) |
| 3 | Indie hackers & solopreneurs | 15 (30%) |
| 4 | Freelancing & digital nomads | 5 (10%) |
| 5 | Growth marketing | 5 (10%) |

## 6 Reply Frameworks (Quick Reference)

1. **Insight Add** — Agree + add new dimension they missed
2. **Experience Share** — "Here's what we learned..." with specific metrics
3. **Thoughtful Question** — Deepen the conversation with a hypothesis
4. **Devil's Advocate** — Respectful counterpoint backed by experience
5. **Resource Pointer** — Share someone else's valuable content + your takeaway
6. **"Yes, And" Riff** — Build on their idea with a related observation

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

- Empty agreement ("Great post! 💯")
- Naked self-promotion ("Check out our tool!")
- Instant replies (<30s) or identical intervals
- Replying to every post from one account

## Voice

Technical + accessible + honest. Share failures. Be specific (tools, numbers, timelines). No corporate speak, no fake hype, no humble bragging.
