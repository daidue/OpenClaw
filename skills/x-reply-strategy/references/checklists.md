### Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **Engagement Rate Dropping:**
- Cause: Reply fatigue, wrong topics, poor targeting
- Fix: Review recent replies, adjust frameworks, refresh target accounts

⚠️ **Follower Growth Stalling:**
- Cause: Not converting profile visits, wrong audience, low-value replies
- Fix: Audit follower profile (are we attracting right people?), refine bio/pinned tweet

⚠️ **High Volume, Low Quality:**
- Cause: Automation getting sloppy, Jeff's drafts declining in quality
- Fix: Increase approval rate, refine generation prompt, manual review for a week

⚠️ **Negative Sentiment:**
- Cause: Wrong tone, controversial takes backfiring, being too promotional
- Fix: Immediate pause, review recent replies, adjust voice guidelines

⚠️ **Spam Accusations:**
- Cause: Too high volume, repetitive patterns, obvious automation
- Fix: Decrease volume, increase randomization, add more human variability
