## WHAT to Reply About: Topic Authority

### Content Pillars: What We're Known For

Our goal is to build authority in the intersection of **AI agents × automation × indie building**. Focus replies on these 5 pillars:

#### Pillar 1: AI Agent Architecture & Implementation (30% of replies)
- Agent reasoning patterns and decision-making
- Prompt engineering for agents vs. single-shot LLM calls
- Memory systems (vector, graph, hybrid approaches)
- Tool/function calling best practices
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Error handling and reliability patterns
- Cost optimization strategies

**Target accounts:** @LangChainAI, @AnthropicAI, @OpenClawAI, @hwchase17, @yacineMTB

---

#### Pillar 2: Automation Workflows & Integration (25% of replies)
- Workflow design patterns
- Tool comparisons (Zapier vs. n8n vs. custom)
- API integration challenges and solutions
- No-code vs. low-code vs. full-code tradeoffs
- Event-driven architectures
- Error handling in automated workflows
- Real-world automation case studies

**Target accounts:** @n8n_io, @zapier, @BenLang, @jakezward

#### Pillar 3: Indie Building & Product Development (25% of replies)
- Solo founder workflows and productivity
- MVP development strategies
- Customer acquisition for early-stage products
- Pricing and positioning for small products
- Tech stack decisions for solo devs
- Building in public vs. stealth mode
- Revenue milestones and growth tactics

### Topic Authority Matrix: What to Say Yes/No To

| Topic | Engage? | Positioning |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| AI agent architectures | ✅ YES | Share implementation experience, technical tradeoffs |
| Prompt engineering | ✅ YES | Practical patterns, what works/doesn't in production |
| LLM model comparisons | ⚠️ SELECTIVE | Only if we have direct experience with both models |
| AI ethics/philosophy | ❌ NO | Outside our expertise, crowded conversation |
| Automation workflows | ✅ YES | Our sweet spot, share real implementations |
| No-code tool debates | ✅ YES | Informed opinions, practical tradeoffs |
| Indie hacker revenue posts | ✅ YES | Celebrate wins, ask about specifics, share learnings |
| Startup fundraising advice | ❌ NO | Not our lane, lots of VCs already commenting |
| Personal productivity systems | ⚠️ SELECTIVE | Only if automation/AI-related |
| Programming languages/frameworks | ⚠️ SELECTIVE | Only if relevant to agent/automation context |
| Design and UI/UX | ❌ NO | Outside expertise zone |
| Marketing and content strategy | ⚠️ SELECTIVE | Only growth/acquisition for product builders |
| Remote work culture | ❌ NO | Saturated topic, not our differentiation |
| Crypto/web3 | ❌ NO | Not our focus area |

**The Test:** Before replying, ask:
1. "Do I have genuine insight here?" (not just an opinion)
2. "Is this consistent with our authority pillars?"
3. "Would someone follow me based on this reply?"

If any answer is no → skip the reply opportunity

### Building "Reply Guy" Reputation (The Right Way)

**The Right Way:**
- Consistently add value in specific topic areas
- People start recognizing your name/avatar
- Other users mention you in relevant threads ("cc @ourhandle, you've built this")
- Original posters engage with your replies
- Your replies get likes/retweets from third parties (not just OP)

**The Wrong Way (Avoid):**
- Replying to EVERY post from certain accounts (looks desperate)
- Always agreeing (no unique perspective)
- Formulaic replies (people spot the template)
- Replying just for visibility (no value added)

**Signs You're Doing It Right:**
- Follow-up questions from OP or others
- Quote tweets of your replies
- DMs asking to continue the conversation
- Invites to collaborate or contribute
- Other accounts start tagging you in relevant threads

### Content Pillars: Replies vs. Original Posts

**Replies (80% of our content):**
- React to others' ideas
- Share specific implementations and learnings
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Add nuance to existing conversations
- Build relationships and visibility

**Original Posts (20% of our content):**
- Share our own projects and experiments
- Tutorial threads on technical topics
- Weekly learnings and insights
- Contrarian takes on industry trends
- Results from automation experiments

**Why this split?**
- Replies build network effects and reach
- Original posts establish independent thought leadership
- 80/20 ratio optimal for growth + authority building
