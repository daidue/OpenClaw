## Metrics and Iteration

### North Star Metrics

**Primary Goal:** Build engaged audience of AI/automation practitioners

**Key Metrics (in priority order):**

1. **Follower Growth Rate** (weekly)
   - Target: +50-100 followers/week (months 1-2)
   - Target: +150-250 followers/week (months 3-4)
   - Target: +300-500 followers/week (month 6+)

2. **Engagement Rate** (replies + likes + RTs per reply)
   - Target: 3+ avg engagement per reply
   - Top quartile should be 10+ engagement
   - Bottom quartile <1 engagement (needs review)

3. **Profile Visit:Follower Ratio**
   - Target: >10% conversion (100 visits → 10+ followers)
   - Industry benchmark: 5-15% for quality accounts

4. **Reply Success Rate**
   - Target: <30% of replies with 0 engagement
   - Target: >20% of replies with 5+ engagement

### Weekly Review Process

**Every Monday Morning (30 minutes):**

1. **Review Dashboard**
   - Did we hit reply volume targets? (40-50/day)
   - Which replies performed best? Identify patterns
   - Which replies flopped? Why?
   - Follower growth on track?

2. **Top Performer Analysis**
   - What made the top 5 replies successful?
   - Can we replicate the pattern?
   - Which framework/topic/target account?

3. **Bottom Performer Analysis**
   - Why did bottom 5 replies fail?
   - Wrong topic? Wrong tone? Wrong timing?
   - Pattern of mistakes (avoid in future)

4. **Target Account Review**
   - Which accounts yielded best engagement per reply?
   - Are we over-replying to any account? (>20% of their posts)
   - Any new accounts to add to targets?
   - Any accounts to remove? (gone dormant, low ROI)

5. **Adjust Strategy**
   - Update reply frameworks based on learnings
   - Shift target account mix (more to what works)
   - Refine topic focus (double down on high-performers)
   - Update Jeff's generation prompt if needed

### Monthly Deep Dive

**First Monday of Each Month (2 hours):**

1. **Comprehensive Metrics Review**
   - Month-over-month growth in all metrics
   - Trend analysis (accelerating or plateauing?)
   - Engagement rate by topic pillar
   - Framework performance over time

2. **Follower Quality Analysis**
   - Sample 20 new followers: Are they in target audience?
   - What content/replies drove them to follow?
   - Are they engaging with our content?
   - Any bot/spam followers? (normal: 5-10%)

3. **Competitive Benchmarking**
   - How are similar accounts growing?
   - What tactics are they using successfully?
   - Any gaps in our strategy vs. theirs?

4. **Strategic Pivots**
   - Should we add/remove topic pillars?
   - Shift target account mix? (new communities emerging?)
   - Change reply volume or timing?
   - Introduce new content formats? (threads, original posts)

5. **Experimentation Planning**
   - Pick 1-2 experiments to run next month
   - Examples:
     - Test higher reply volume (60/day vs 40/day)
     - Test thread replies vs single replies
     - Test new target accounts in adjacent niche
     - Test different voice/tone in subset of replies

### When to Pivot (Decision Framework)

**Double Down (Keep Doing More):**
- ✅ Topic/framework with >4.0 avg engagement
- ✅ Target account with >15% follow-back rate
- ✅ Time window with >5.0 avg engagement
- ✅ Any tactic showing clear month-over-month improvement

**Adjust (Needs Refinement):**
- ⚠️ Topic/framework with 2.0-3.0 avg engagement
- ⚠️ Target account with 5-10% follow-back rate
- ⚠️ Replies getting likes but no follower growth (not converting)
- ⚠️ High volume but quality concerns (spam-like patterns emerging)

**Kill (Stop Immediately):**
- ❌ Topic/framework with <1.5 avg engagement after 50+ replies
- ❌ Target account with <3% follow-back rate and low engagement
- ❌ Any tactic generating negative sentiment or backlash
- ❌ Anything that feels inauthentic or forced (trust your gut)

### A/B Testing Framework

**What to Test:**
- Reply frameworks (Experience Share vs Thoughtful Question)
- Topics (AI agents vs automation workflows)
- Target accounts (high-follower vs mid-follower accounts)
- Timing (morning vs afternoon vs evening)
- Reply length (concise vs detailed)
- Mention frequency (10% self-mention vs 5% vs 0%)

**How to Test:**
1. **Hypothesis**: "Experience Share replies will outperform Thoughtful Questions"
2. **Split**: 20 replies of each type over 1 week
3. **Measure**: Avg engagement, follow-back rate
4. **Analyze**: Statistical significance? Pattern consistent?
5. **Implement**: If winner is clear, shift mix accordingly
6. **Iterate**: Test next hypothesis

**Test Duration:** Minimum 20 replies per variant to reach significance
