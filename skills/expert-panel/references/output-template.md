## Notes

- **Always include the revised/final content** — the review is only useful if it produces an improved version
- **Implementation notes are required** — reviewers should specify exactly what to do with the output
- **Keep expert feedback specific** — "needs improvement" is useless; "rewrite the CTA from 'I want this' to 'Get Instant Access — $27'" is actionable
- **Quote the content** when critiquing it — show exactly what you're talking about
