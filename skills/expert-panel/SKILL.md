# Expert Panel Review

Structured review process using 10 simulated domain experts who score content 1-100, provide specific feedback, and iterate until the aggregate score hits **95+**.

## When to Use

- Product listings (Gumroad, marketplaces)
- Social media profiles and bios
- Landing pages and sales copy
- GTM materials, pitch decks
- Any public-facing content that needs to convert

## Process

1. **Define the content** and its goal (convert, inform, build trust, etc.)
2. **Assemble 10 experts** — pick roles relevant to the content type (see `references/expert-roles.md`)
3. **Round 1**: Each expert scores 1-100, provides strengths/weaknesses/recommendations
4. **Synthesize**: Average score, identify lowest-scoring areas, create prioritized fix list
5. **Revise** the content incorporating critical and high-impact feedback
6. **Round 2+**: Re-evaluate until average score ≥ 95
7. **Output**: Final approved version + implementation notes
