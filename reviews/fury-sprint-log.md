**Priority 1: Invoice Tracker Competitive Monitor** - COMPLETE

**Time:** 16:11-16:15 EST (4 minutes)

**Activities:**
- Researched current pricing and features for 5 competitors:
  - FreshBooks: $23-70/month
  - QuickBooks Self-Employed: $15/month  
  - Wave: FREE-$19/month
  - HoneyBook: $29-109/month
  - Bonsai: $9-49/month
- Fetched official pricing pages and feature lists
- Analyzed market positioning vs. our $27 Notion template
- Documented pricing trends and customer sentiment

**Key Findings:**
🚨 **CRITICAL:** Wave's free tier is our biggest threat for price-conscious users
🎯 **OPPORTUNITY:** HoneyBook's recent price increases (to $59/month) causing customer dissatisfaction - potential refugee market
💰 **POSITIONING WIN:** We're 85-95% cheaper than paid competitors on annual basis

**Deliverable:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/research/invoice-tracker-competitive-update-feb8.md` (12KB, comprehensive analysis)

**Sources Used:**
- freshbooks.com/pricing
- waveapps.com/pricing  
- honeybook.com/pricing
- hellobonsai.com/pricing
- business.org (QuickBooks research)
- Reddit r/weddingvideography (HoneyBook pricing complaints)
- Technavio market reports

**Recommendations Flagged:**
1. Create "Wave vs. Our Template" comparison content (address free tier head-on)
2. Target HoneyBook refugees with lower-cost messaging
3. Emphasize transaction fee savings (Wave charges 2.9% + $0.60/transaction)
4. Position as "Notion-native" solution for workflow integration

**Next:** Priority 2 (Monday) - SEO Keyword Deep Dive
