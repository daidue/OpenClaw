# Shared Learnings

Cross-agent knowledge base. When any agent learns something valuable, it writes here.
All agents read this folder on startup.

## Folders

| Folder | Purpose | Primary Contributors |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `sales/` | Outreach patterns, what converts, deal insights | Jeff, Fury |
| `content/` | What performs, voice/tone, platform nuances | Nova |
| `seo/` | Ranking patterns, keywords, technical SEO | Fury |
| `technical/` | Code patterns, debugging, infrastructure | Bolt |
| `general/` | Cross-domain insights, meta-learnings | All |

## How to Write Learnings

Use this format:
```markdown
# [Short Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Source:** [What task/situation taught this]
**Confidence:** High/Medium/Low

## Learning
[What we learned]

## Application
[How to apply this going forward]
```

## Rules

1. **Be specific** — "Reddit posts with numbers get 2x engagement" beats "be engaging"
2. **Include evidence** — What data/result proved this?
3. **Update, don't duplicate** — If a learning evolves, update the existing file
4. **Prune stale learnings** — Delete what's no longer true
