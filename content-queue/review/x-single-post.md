## Version 1 (Pain → Solution — LEAD WITH THIS)

Lost track of $2,400 in overdue invoices last month because my spreadsheet system was a mess.

Built a free Notion tracker with auto-calculations, status views, and a payment follow-up script.

Used it for 3 months — caught $1,200 in payments I would've missed.

## Hashtag Strategy
Pick 1 per tweet max (naturally integrated):
- #Notion (best reach for this product)
- #FreelanceLife (community-focused)
- #SoloPreneur (aspirational framing)

**Don't use:** #NotionTemplate (too spammy), #FreelanceTips (too broad)

## Rotation Strategy
- **Day 1:** Post Version 1 (pain-focused) at 11am
- **Day 3:** Repost Version 2 (feature-focused) at 8pm
- **Day 5:** Post Version 4 (results-focused) at 1pm
- **Day 7+:** Rotate Version 3 (community-direct) after thread or other posts have built some recognition

---

## Notes
- Version 1 will convert best for cold audiences (pain + proof)
- Version 2 is safest for reposts (clean, scannable)
- Version 3 requires existing awareness (don't lead with this)
- Version 4 leads with results (good for retargeting people who've seen V1)
- Track which version gets the most link clicks in X analytics
- Attach a screenshot to Version 2 for better engagement
