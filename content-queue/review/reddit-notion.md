## Title
[Free Template] Freelance Invoice Tracker with auto-calculations, status tracking, and payment follow-up script

---

## Body

I built an invoice tracker for freelancers after realizing I had $2,400 in overdue payments I'd lost track of.

**What's included:**
- **Payment follow-up email script** (pre-written, ready to customize)
- **Auto-calculation formulas** (set invoice items, totals calculate automatically)
- **Status tracking views** (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue)
- **4 pre-loaded sample invoices** from my own client work (shows exactly how to use it)
- **Works on Notion Free plan** (no paid features required)

**Who it's for:**
Freelancers, consultants, or solo creators who want organized invoice tracking without another subscription.

**Proof:** I've been using this for 3 months and tracked 23 invoices through it. Caught $1,200 in payments that would've fallen through the cracks with my old spreadsheet system.

I'd love to see how you customize it if you try it out! Open to feedback and suggestions.

## Response Templates

**If asked about features:**
"Right now it's focused on tracking and calculation essentials. I kept it lightweight intentionally. What specific feature would make it more useful for your workflow?"

**If someone shares their own invoice system:**
"That's a great setup! I love seeing different approaches. [Ask a genuine question about their system — e.g., 'How do you handle recurring invoices?']"

**If asked why Gumroad for a free template:**
"Gumroad makes it easy to deliver cleanly and collect feedback in one place. Plus it lets me offer the expanded $27 toolkit without pressuring anyone who just wants the free version."

**If asked about duplication/setup:**
"Click the link, hit 'I want this,' then on the delivery page click 'Duplicate to your Notion.' Takes about 30 seconds. The 4 sample invoices show you exactly how to customize it for your clients."

**If someone reports customization questions:**
"Great question! The sample invoices show the structure — you can add/remove fields from the database properties panel. Want me to point you to a good Notion tutorial on database customization?"
