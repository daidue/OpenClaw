## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook + Link):**
I lost track of $2,400 in overdue invoices last month.

The reason? Zero system for tracking them.

So I built a free Notion invoice tracker. Grab it here:

Here's what's inside 👇

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
The problem with spreadsheet tracking:
- Manual calculations = math errors
- No status system = forgotten invoices
- No follow-up system = awkward guessing
- Messy history = zero clarity on who owes what

I needed something lightweight that actually worked.

**Tweet 3 (The Solution):**
This free tracker includes:

✅ Payment follow-up email script (pre-written, ready to send)
✅ Auto-calculations (set your line items, totals happen automatically)
✅ Status tracking (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue)
✅ 4 sample invoices from my real client work
✅ Works on Notion's FREE plan

**Tweet 4 (Proof + Story):**
I built this for myself first. Used it for 3 months, tracked 23 invoices.

Result: Caught $1,200 in payments that would've slipped through with my old system.

Then I cleaned it up and pre-loaded 4 real examples so you can see exactly how it works.

If you freelance and use #Notion, grab it for free:

No catch. No trial. Just a tool that works.

If you try it, let me know what you think — I'm building more freelance tools and your feedback helps 👊

Here's what the dashboard looks like — status filters, auto-calculated totals, and the 4 pre-loaded samples:

Takes ~30 seconds to duplicate into your Notion workspace.

## Engagement Responses

**If someone asks "what's the upsell?":**
"Fair question! There's a $27 Professional Toolkit with 6 databases and more automation, but this free tracker is fully functional on its own. No features locked, no trial period — use it as long as you want."

**If someone tags a friend:**
Like and reply: "Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps @[friend] 🙌"

**If someone shares their result/screenshot:**
Retweet or quote tweet with: "Love seeing this! 🔥 [specific reaction to their screenshot/comment]"

**If someone asks for a specific feature:**
"That's a solid idea! What's your use case for [feature]? Might build that into the next version."

**If someone asks "is this really free?":**
"Really free. I'm building a 'Jeff on Notion' brand for freelance templates and want to lead with value. This tracker is complete — the paid toolkit is separate (and optional)."
