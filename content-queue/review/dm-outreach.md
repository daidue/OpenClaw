## Template V1 (Standard — For Acquaintances/Mutuals)

Hey [Name]!

Quick favor — I just launched a free Notion invoice tracker and I'd love your honest take on it.

Built it after realizing I had $2,400 in overdue invoices I'd lost track of (whoops). It's got auto-calculations, status tracking, and a pre-written payment follow-up email script.

Would you mind checking it out? Specifically curious if the follow-up email script feels natural or too templated.

No pressure at all if you're swamped!

## Template V2 (Notion User — For People You Know Use Notion)

Hey [Name]!

I know you're into Notion — just built a free invoice tracker and wanted to get your feedback before I share it wider.

Tracked 23 invoices through it over the last 3 months. Has auto-calculations, status views, and a payment follow-up script.

What would make it actually useful for you? I pre-loaded 4 sample invoices but curious if the structure makes sense.

Let me know if you have 5 mins to poke around!

## Template V3 (Qualifier — For Freelancers You're Unsure Use Notion)

Hey [Name]!

Random question — do you use Notion for any of your freelance admin stuff?

I just built a free invoice tracker template and I'm hunting for feedback from actual freelancers (not just randos on the internet).

If you use Notion: https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/free-invoice-tracker

Would love your brutally honest take. Built it to solve my own "forgot to follow up on $2,400" problem.

If you don't use Notion, no worries — what do you use for invoice tracking? (Genuinely curious)

## Template V4 (Close Friend/Frequent Collaborator — Super Casual)

Yo [Name]!

Built a thing. Need your brain.

Free Notion invoice tracker — auto-calculations, status tracking, payment follow-up script.

Take a look? https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/free-invoice-tracker

Specifically tell me if the follow-up email script sounds like a robot wrote it or if it's actually usable.

Be mean if it sucks. I can handle it 😂

## Personalization Checklist
Before sending, customize:
- [ ] Use their actual name (not "Name")
- [ ] Reference something recent (their project, a conversation, shared interest)
- [ ] Match their communication style (formal vs casual)
- [ ] If you haven't talked in a while, acknowledge it: "Long time! How've you been?"
- [ ] Make it genuinely easy to say no
- [ ] Give them a SPECIFIC feedback prompt (not just "what do you think?")

---

## Response Handling

**If they try it and give feedback:**
"This is super helpful, thank you! [Respond specifically to their feedback]. Really appreciate you taking the time — want me to send you the updated version once I tweak [thing they mentioned]?"

**If they say "I don't use Notion":**
"No worries at all! What do you use for invoice tracking? I'm always curious how other freelancers handle this stuff."

**If they don't respond after 48 hours:**
**Let it go.** Do NOT follow up. They're busy or not interested. Both are fine.

**If they download and love it:**
"Awesome! Mind if I circle back in a couple weeks with the results from this launch? Building more freelance tools and your input helps."

**If they ask about the paid version:**
"Yeah, I have a $27 Professional Toolkit with 6 databases and more email scripts, but honestly this free tracker is solid on its own. Only upgrade if you actually need the extra features."

**If they share it with someone:**
"Oh wow, thank you! That's really kind. Let me know if [person they shared with] has feedback too."

## Relationship-Building Follow-Up (2 Weeks Later)

For people who downloaded and gave feedback, send this after your launch:

---

"Hey [Name]! Quick update — that invoice tracker you helped me test got [X downloads] in the first week. Your feedback about [specific thing they mentioned] helped a ton.

Thanks for being a guinea pig 😄

How's [their project/thing you talked about] going?"

---

This builds launch partners for future products. You're closing the loop and showing you valued their input.

---

## Success Metrics
- **10-15 messages sent** (don't go over 15)
- **3-5 downloads** (30-50% conversion is realistic among friends)
- **1-2 pieces of actionable feedback** (specific improvements to make)
- **0 people annoyed** (if anyone seems put off, stop immediately and reassess your approach)
- **2-3 relationships strengthened** (this should deepen connections, not extract value)

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to Send)
- ❌ You haven't talked to them in 6+ months
- ❌ They're currently dealing with something hard (job loss, personal crisis)
- ❌ Your last interaction was them asking YOU for something (don't create a favor imbalance)
- ❌ They've posted about being overwhelmed with DM requests
- ❌ You're sending to hit a number (quality > quantity)
