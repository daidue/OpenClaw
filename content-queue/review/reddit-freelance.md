## Title
I built a free Notion invoice tracker after losing track of $2,400 in overdue payments

---

## Body

Last month I realized I had $2,400 sitting in overdue invoices. Why? Because my spreadsheet tracking system was a mess and I kept forgetting to follow up.

So I built a Notion invoice tracker that actually works:

**→ Payment follow-up email script** (because asking for money is awkward)  
**→ Auto-calculates totals** (no more manual math errors)  
**→ Status tracking** (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue at a glance)  
**→ 4 sample invoices pre-loaded** from my own client work so you can see exactly how it works  
**→ Runs on Notion's free plan** (no extra subscriptions)

I've been using it for 3 months — caught $1,200 in payments that would've slipped through the cracks.

If you try it and have suggestions, I'm all ears. Built this to solve my own problem, figured it might help some of you too.

## Engagement Tips

**Reply to these types of comments quickly:**
1. **Questions about features:** Be specific and helpful
2. **"Thanks, will try it!":** "Hope it helps! Let me know if you hit any issues"
3. **Alternative tool mentions:** "That's a great option too! I built this for people already using Notion"
4. **Criticism/feedback:** "That's a fair point — I'll add it to my improvement list. Thanks for the feedback!"
5. **"Is there a paid version?":** "I have a $27 Professional Toolkit with more features, but this free tracker is fully functional on its own — no catch"

**Avoid:**
- Sounding defensive
- Over-promoting the paid version
- Ignoring critical comments
- Using sales language

**If someone asks "what's the catch?":**
"No catch! I built this for myself first and used it for 3 months. I'm sharing it to help other freelancers + build credibility as a Notion template creator. There is a paid toolkit if you want more advanced features later, but this free one is complete and fully functional."

**If someone asks for proof:**
"Fair question! I pre-loaded 4 real invoices from my own client projects (anonymized) so you can see exactly how it works before you customize it. I've tracked 23 invoices through it over 3 months."
