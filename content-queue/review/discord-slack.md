## Template (Discord/Slack — Standard Version)

Hey everyone! 👋

Last month I realized I'd lost track of $2,400 in overdue invoices because my spreadsheet system was a disaster.

So I built a free Notion invoice tracker and figured I'd share it here:

**What it does:**
- **Payment follow-up email script** (pre-written, just customize and send)
- **Auto-calculations** (set your line items, totals calculate automatically)
- **Status tracking** (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue views)
- **4 pre-loaded sample invoices** from my own client work so you can see exactly how it works
- **Works on Notion's free plan** (no paid features required)

**Proof:** I've used this for 3 months and tracked 23 invoices through it. Caught $1,200 in payments that would've fallen through the cracks with my old system.

**Get it here (free):**

Open to feedback if you try it out! I'm building more freelance tools and curious what would actually be useful.

## Notion-Specific Communities Version

Just published a free freelance invoice tracker template! 📄

**Built this because:** I had $2,400 in overdue invoices I'd completely lost track of in spreadsheets.

**What's included:**
✅ Auto-calculation formulas  
✅ Status views (Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue)  
✅ Pre-written payment follow-up email script  
✅ 4 real sample invoices from my client work (shows exactly how to use it)  
✅ Free plan compatible (no paid Notion features)

**Proof:** Tracked 23 invoices over 3 months. Caught $1,200 in payments that would've slipped through with my old system.

**Link:** https://jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/free-invoice-tracker

Would love to hear how you customize it if you try it out! Always curious how other people organize their Notion workflows.

## Response Templates

**If someone asks "Can you share a screenshot?":**
"Sure! Don't want to clutter the channel, but here's the main dashboard: [upload clean screenshot]. The 4 sample invoices show you exactly how to set it up for your own clients."

**If someone asks "Is this really free or is there a catch?":**
"Really free! I do have a $27 Professional Toolkit with 6 databases and more automation, but this invoice tracker is complete and fully functional on its own. No trial, no locked features, no bait-and-switch. Use it as long as you want."

**If someone reports a bug or issue:**
"Oh no! Thanks for flagging that — can you DM me the details? I'll get it fixed ASAP. Appreciate you testing it!"

**If someone shares their own invoice template:**
"That's awesome! Love seeing different approaches. [Ask a genuine question about their template, e.g., 'How do you handle recurring invoices in your setup?']"

**If someone asks about customization:**
"The 4 sample invoices are set up to show you the structure — you can add/remove database properties based on what you track. Want me to point you to a good Notion tutorial on database customization? Or DM me your specific question and I'll help walk you through it."

**If a mod questions the post:**
"Totally understand! Happy to take this down if it doesn't fit the channel vibe. Just thought it might help some folks here. Let me know what works best for the community."

**If someone asks "Why Gumroad for a free template?":**
"Gumroad makes it easy to deliver and collect feedback in one place. Plus I can offer the $27 toolkit separately for people who want more features without pressuring anyone who just wants the free version."

## Important Guidelines

**Before Posting:**
1. **Be a member first** — Don't join just to drop a link. Engage authentically for 3-5 days first.
2. **Read the rules** — Some servers require mod approval for self-promo. Ask first.
3. **Search the server** — Has someone else recently shared an invoice tracker? Don't duplicate.
4. **Check channel descriptions** — Is this the right channel for templates/resources?
5. **Respect the culture** — Some communities are strict about self-promotion, others are open. Follow the vibe.

**After Posting:**
1. **Engage beyond your post** — React to others' shares, answer questions, be a real member.
2. **Respond to all comments** within 24 hours (even just "thanks!" for positive reactions).
3. **Don't cross-post immediately** — Space out posts across different communities by 24-48 hours.
4. **Be helpful, not defensive** — If someone criticizes, thank them and engage genuinely.
5. **If it feels spammy, don't post** — When in doubt, ask a mod first.

## Red Flags (When NOT to Post)

- ❌ You joined the server within the last week
- ❌ The community has had multiple recent template shares (you'll look spammy)
- ❌ Server rules explicitly say "no self-promotion" (ask a mod first)
- ❌ You haven't contributed anything to the community yet
- ❌ Another invoice tracker was shared in the last 2 weeks
- ❌ The channel culture is strictly anti-commercial (even for free products)

---

## Success Metrics

- **3-5 communities posted in** (quality over quantity)
- **Positive reception** (upvotes/reactions, not just link clicks)
- **2-5 downloads per community** (realistic for cold communities)
- **0 mod warnings** (if you get warned, learn and adjust)
- **Bonus:** Genuine conversations started (people asking questions, sharing their setups, engaging beyond your post)
- **Relationship equity:** You're building presence in these communities for future launches

## Follow-Up Strategy (2 Weeks Later)
