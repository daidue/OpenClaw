# Autonomous Mode

## Status: OFF

When **ON**, Jeff operates independently:
- Executes tasks from WORKQUEUE.md without asking
- Spawns sub-agents for complex work
- Makes commits, sends emails, creates drafts
- Works until queue is empty or safe word is invoked

## Safe Word: **FULL STOP**

Say "FULL STOP" to immediately:
1. Halt all autonomous work
2. Get a status report of what was in progress
3. Return to interactive mode

## Toggle Commands

- **"Go autonomous"** or **"Jeff, go"** → Enables autonomous mode
- **"FULL STOP"** → Disables autonomous mode immediately

## Boundaries (even in autonomous mode)

- ✅ Can: Code, commit, draft content, research, organize, email partners
- ⚠️ Ask first: Public posts (X, etc.), external emails to strangers, spending money
- ❌ Never: Delete important files, share private data, bypass security

_Last toggled: Never_
