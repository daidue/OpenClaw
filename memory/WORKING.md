## Completed This Session

- [x] Created AUTONOMOUS.md (toggle for autonomous mode)
- [x] Created WORKQUEUE.md (task queue)

## Key Learnings Extracted

From 60+ bookmarks, the biggest insights:
1. **Checkpoint loops** — Write to files constantly, context dies on restart
2. **Self-review protocol** — Log mistakes with tags, read on boot
3. **Multi-agent architecture** — Specialized agents with staggered heartbeats
4. **QMD** — Already installed, cuts tokens 96%
5. **Business opportunities** — Polymarket arbitrage, UGC video, digital products

## Next Steps

1. Taylor to review PLAYBOOK.md
2. Consider multi-agent expansion (specialized agents)
3. Explore Polymarket automation opportunity
4. Test autonomous mode on real task

## Blockers

None.
