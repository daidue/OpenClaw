✅ AUTONOMOUS SESSION COMPLETE — Awaiting review with Taylor.

## Completed This Session

### Earlier (Pre-Autonomous)
- [x] Created AUTONOMOUS.md (toggle for autonomous mode)
- [x] Created WORKQUEUE.md (task queue)
- [x] Updated HEARTBEAT.md (with checkpoint loop + self-review)
- [x] Created memory/self-review.md (continuous improvement)
- [x] Pulled all @HaylorTawes bookmarks via bird CLI
- [x] Created PLAYBOOK.md — comprehensive tactics document

### Autonomous Session (17:44-17:52 EST)
- [x] Studied aitmpl.com/agents — 400+ components (agents, commands, MCPs)
- [x] Researched Polymarket automation — $40M opportunity, Python bot available
- [x] Created multi-agent expansion plan — 4-agent architecture proposed
- [x] Created IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md — Full findings documented

## Key Findings

### aitmpl.com
- 400+ Claude Code components
- Install via: `npx claude-code-templates@latest`
- Includes analytics, health check, chat monitor

### Polymarket
- $39.59M extracted in 12 months (research-backed)
- NegRisk strategy = 29× more capital efficient
- Open-source detection bot available
- Window closing as institutions enter (ICE $2B investment)

### Multi-Agent Plan
- Proposed: main → researcher → content → dev
- Staggered heartbeats (2 min apart)
- Start with 1 additional agent, scale based on needs

## Next Steps

1. Review findings with Taylor
2. Decide: Start Polymarket monitoring?
3. Decide: Add researcher agent?
4. Continue in autonomous or interactive mode?

## Blockers

None.
