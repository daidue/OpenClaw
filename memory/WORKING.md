# WORKING.md — Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05 17:30 EST

## Active Focus

Setting up persistent autonomous work mode for Jeff.

## Current Task

Implementing Mission Control-style architecture based on @pbteja1998's guide:
- [x] Created AUTONOMOUS.md (toggle for autonomous mode)
- [x] Created WORKQUEUE.md (task queue)
- [x] Updated HEARTBEAT.md (checklist for heartbeats)
- [x] Created WORKING.md (this file - current state)
- [ ] Test autonomous workflow on first task

## Context

Taylor wants me to operate more independently. Key resources studied:
- Bhanu Teja's Mission Control guide (10 agents, Convex, 15-min heartbeats)
- Bookmarks from @HaylorTawes on making OpenClaw better

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Taylor to enable autonomous mode ("Jeff, go")
2. Process first task from WORKQUEUE.md
3. Iterate on the system based on results

## Blockers

None currently.
