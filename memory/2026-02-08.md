# 2026-02-08 — Big Strategy Day + Polymarket Overhaul + Audience Building

## Major Decisions
- **Pseudonym chosen: Nate Calloway** (@NateCallowayHQ on X) — Taylor's anonymous persona for audience building
- **Revenue pathways analyzed** — Full team review (Fury, Nova, Bolt) of 10 AI agent monetization methods
- **Top 3 revenue streams selected:**
  1. Training & Education (playbooks, courses, newsletter)
  2. ClawHub Marketplace (Jeff builds skills autonomously)
  3. Data Services (market research, competitive intel)
- **Nova pushed back hard** on Fury's timeline — says $8-15K/mo is month 10-12, not month 6. Education without audience = selling to nobody. Data Services should be priority #1 for immediate cash flow.
- **Bolt flagged** ClawHub skills need 2-4x more dev work than estimated, Data Services needs infrastructure
- **Revised strategy:** Data Services first for cash, content/audience building in parallel, education products once audience exists
- **Platform priority:** X/Twitter primary, TikTok/Reels secondary (faceless), Newsletter (owned), avoid LinkedIn
- **Reply strategy designed:** 40-50 replies/day, 2-3 min delays, 6 frameworks, 30+ target accounts mapped
- **"Director + AI Agent" hybrid brand** — Nate provides strategy, Jeff executes 24/7, transparent about AI collab
- **OpenClaw implementation services** added as Tier 2, Month 4-6 (gated on audience milestones)
- **Law firm / compliance vertical** flagged as high-value target for future consulting
- **Noah Epstein article reviewed** — "$100K/mo business model" via OpenClaw setup for enterprises. Taylor's decision: fold into existing plan, revisit once audience established.

## Polymarket Scanner — Complete Overhaul
- **Old scanner killed** — only checked YES+NO arbitrage, never found anything
- **Scanner v2 built (MVP):** NegRisk + new market detector, 500 markets in 1.4s
- **Scanner v2 Week 1 features added:** Volume spikes, price movements, resolution proximity, news monitor, AI assessment, Telegram alerts
- **Parallelized all scanners:** 7.0s → 1.2s (83% faster)
- **Files:** `~/polymarket-arb/v2/` — 11 Python modules, 3K+ lines
- **Whale tracking researched:** Polymarket APIs expose wallet addresses, trade sizes, timestamps for every transaction. WebSocket feed available for real-time monitoring.
- **Théo case study:** French trader put $45M across 4 accounts on Trump 2024, made ~$30M profit. Pattern: 450+ small txs across accounts in 10-hour window.
- **Insider scoring model:** 0-100 scale based on new wallet, timing before news, size vs liquidity, clustering, contrarian positioning
- **Critical insight:** Need WebSocket persistent monitor, not polling. Opportunities vanish in 1-5 minutes.
- **Existing tools:** Polywhaler, PolyAlertHub, Betmoar — can leverage these
- **Next step:** Build WebSocket whale monitor as persistent background service
- **Research docs:** `research/polymarket-strategy-overhaul.md`, `research/polymarket-scanner-architecture.md`, `research/polymarket-whale-tracking.md`

## Waiting On Taylor
- Create ProtonMail account (natecalloway or natecallowayhq)
- Set up Google Voice number
- Create X account (@NateCallowayHQ)
- Log into X in Brave browser so bird CLI gets cookies
- Upload Gumroad Lite thumbnail manually
- Add Notion Lite template share link to Gumroad Content tab
- Deploy landing page (Netlify Drop or similar)
- Set up payout method on Gumroad
- Decide: build WebSocket whale monitor next?

## Scanner Cron — Needs Update
- Old scanner still running hourly via system event
- Should switch to: `cd ~/polymarket-arb/v2 && python3 scanner_wrapper_v2.py --full`
- Or add OpenClaw cron job for v2
