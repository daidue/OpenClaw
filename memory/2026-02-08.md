## Security Fix
- Fixed 2 critical Control UI issues per weekly audit: `allowInsecureAuth` → false, `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` → false
- Gateway restarted successfully, config applied clean

## Template Design Overhaul (completed late 2/7)
- 17 page/database icons updated (consistent emoji system)
- 17 cover images generated, uploaded to imgur, applied — then REMOVED per Taylor's request (prefers minimalist, no custom banners)
- ~30 callouts switched to outlined/default style across all pages
- Sample data expanded: 13 clients, 20 invoices, 12 time entries, 8 expenses
- Cleaned up ~40 duplicate entries from parallel Bolt execution

## Go-To-Market Strategy — Major Pivot
### Key decisions from expert panel:
1. **Price: $37 → $27** — too high for cold traffic from strangers
2. **Product Hunt: REMOVED** — stopped featuring Notion templates in 2024, dead channel
3. **Pinterest: ADDED as Tier 1** — real case study $0→$1,400/mo with Tailwind automation ($13/mo)
4. **Notion Gallery: Day 1 priority** — 6.9M monthly visitors, 30-40% acceptance rate
5. **Reddit: pushed to Month 2** — needs 30+ days karma building, strict self-promo rules
6. **Gumroad Discover: need 10 transactions** — Lite PWYW version gets us there fast
7. **Email capture: Day 1** — Carrd landing page for Lite version funnel

### Launch sequence (revised):
1. Submit Notion Gallery + NotionEverything + Prototion (Day 1)
2. Pinterest Business + Tailwind + 10 pins (Day 1-2)
3. Gumroad Full ($27) + Lite (PWYW) published (Day 3)
4. Medium article + Dev.to cross-post (Day 3)
5. Etsy listing (Week 2)
6. Reddit (Month 2 after karma building)
