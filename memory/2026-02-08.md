# 2026-02-08 — Big Strategy Day

## Major Decisions
- **Pseudonym chosen: Nate Calloway** (@NateCallowayHQ on X) — Taylor's anonymous persona for audience building
- **Revenue pathways analyzed** — Full team review (Fury, Nova, Bolt) of 10 AI agent monetization methods
- **Top 3 revenue streams selected:**
  1. Training & Education (playbooks, courses, newsletter)
  2. ClawHub Marketplace (Jeff builds skills autonomously)
  3. Data Services (market research, competitive intel)
- **Nova pushed back hard** on Fury's timeline — says $8-15K/mo is month 10-12, not month 6. Education without audience = selling to nobody. Data Services should be priority #1 for immediate cash flow.
- **Bolt flagged** ClawHub skills need 2-4x more dev work than estimated, Data Services needs infrastructure (DB, client portals, ~65-100 hours)
- **Revised strategy:** Data Services first for cash, content/audience building in parallel, education products once audience exists (month 4-6+)
- **Platform priority:** X/Twitter primary, TikTok/Reels secondary (faceless), Newsletter (owned), avoid LinkedIn
- **Reply strategy designed:** 40-50 replies/day, 2-3 min delays, 6 frameworks, 30+ target accounts mapped
- **"Director + AI Agent" hybrid brand** — Nate provides strategy, Jeff executes 24/7, transparent about AI collab
