| # | Type | Subreddit | Post | Comment Summary |
|---|------|-----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Helpful (karma) | r/Notion | [Notion newbie seeking for advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r1xn67/notion_newbie_seeking_for_advice/) | Detailed tips: linked databases, rollups+relations, template buttons, spaced repetition tracker. "Function first, aesthetics later." |
| 2 | Helpful (karma) | r/Notion | [Can you have one calendar view that pulls in from multiple databases?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r1yzmp/can_you_have_one_calendar_view_that_pulls_in_from/) | Explained Notion Calendar app + linked views approach. Recommended keeping separate DBs. |
| 3 | Soft promo | r/freelance | [Looking for advice after a payment dispute](https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1qqtkoh/looking_for_advice_after_a_payment_dispute_with_a/) | Advice on demand letters, small claims, documentation. Mentioned tracking invoices with status pipeline (draft→sent→paid→overdue) — natural lead-in to our template concept without direct link. |

### Inbox Check
- 1 unread: AmberUK reply on "database not loading" post (just a thank-you, no action needed)
- No DMs requesting Gumroad links
- Note: Reddit has archived old-style PMs → now uses Reddit Chat for DMs

### Observations
- r/Notion/new: ~25 posts in 24h. Good mix of questions (formulas, calendar, newbie advice). Several template sellers posting too.
- r/freelance: Very slow (2 posts in 24h, most recent content is 6+ days old). Payment/invoicing threads exist but are older. Good for occasional comments.
- Karma building going well — answering real questions establishes credibility.
- Next sweep: try r/Notiontemplates and r/smallbusiness for variety.
