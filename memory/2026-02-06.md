## Daily Operating Rhythm Established

Taylor and I set up an async work rhythm:

**Morning Standup (8:30 AM):** Cron job pings Taylor via Telegram with overnight summary
**Evening Planning (9:00 PM):** Cron job recaps day + confirms overnight queue

### Cron Jobs Created
- `morning-standup` — 8:30 AM EST daily
- `evening-planning` — 9:00 PM EST daily

### Work Queue Updated
New format with day/night categorization:
- 🌙 **Tonight's Queue** — light overnight work (research, drafts, organizing)
- ☀️ **Daytime Queue** — needs Taylor or interactive work

### First Overnight Tasks Queued
1. Research: Tailscale setup for Mac mini (assigned to Fury)
2. Research: Command allowlist for prompt injection protection (assigned to Fury)

## Notes

- Missed the 8:30 AM security reminder ping — it fired as system event but nobody saw it
- Solution: important reminders now go through cron with Telegram delivery
- Autonomy framework already in place (AUTONOMOUS.md), just needed activation

## TODO
- [ ] Tonight: Fury processes research tasks
- [ ] Tomorrow AM: First real morning standup fires
