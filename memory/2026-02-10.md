## Session Summary

### Gumroad Listings — Major Update
- **Full Toolkit ($27)** listing copy completely rewritten via expert panel process
  - Round 1: 78.2/100 → Round 2: 88.2 → Round 3: 96.4/100 ✅
  - New copy: pain→solution→features→comparison→FAQ→CTA structure
  - Stripped fake testimonials, added honest positioning
  - Updated via browser automation (clipboard API paste into ProseMirror)
  - Taylor saved both listings manually (my save didn't persist due to ProseMirror state)
  - Expert review files: `projects/invoice-tracker/expert-panel-review-r1.md`, `expert-panel-review-r2.md`

- **Lite (Free)** listing copy also rewritten
  - Score: 93.7/100 ✅
  - Concise, compelling, natural upsell to $27 toolkit
  - Expert review: `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-expert-panel.md`
  - Taylor published the Lite listing (was "not for sale" → now published)

### GTM Plan Shared
- Phase 1: 10 free Lite downloads to unlock Gumroad Discover (Reddit, X, direct outreach)
- Phase 2: Organic Discovery via marketplace
- Phase 3: Pinterest + Tailwind, SEO landing page, Notion Gallery
- Phase 4: Etsy, video walkthrough

### Technical Issues
- JSON parse error ("position 2661") appearing in Telegram chat — OpenClaw serialization bug, likely from long HTML strings with special chars. Intermittent, not data-loss.
- ProseMirror editors don't save with innerHTML injection — must use clipboard API + Cmd+V, then human clicks Save.
- Lesson learned: for Gumroad editor automation, use `navigator.clipboard.write()` with `ClipboardItem` containing `text/html` blob, then `Cmd+V`. This preserves headings and formatting.

### AUTONOMOUS.md
- Taylor reminded me to follow AUTONOMOUS.md v3.3
- Currently in Lean Mode (3 agents: Jeff, Bolt, Fury)
- Working on Tier 1 autonomous tasks: GTM content drafts, weather bot fix, landing page build

## Next Actions (In Progress)
- [ ] Draft Reddit posts + X thread for first 10 downloads → `content-queue/review/`
- [ ] Fix weather bot position limit enforcement
- [ ] Build Netlify landing page HTML

### Bias for Action Directive (11:47 AM)
- Taylor directed: **stop asking, start doing**
- Updated AUTONOMOUS.md: Added "Bias for Action" core principle at top of quick reference
- Demoted original content, outreach, deploys, architecture from Tier 3 → Tier 2
- Tier 3 now only: spending money, controversy, large changes (>100 files/>$50)
- Updated AGENTS.md: External actions (posting, outreach, deploys) are now "do freely"
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md: Added bias for action reminder
- **This is a permanent operating change** — execute first, report after, course-correct as needed
