## Session Summary

### Gumroad Listings — Major Update
- **Full Toolkit ($27)** listing copy completely rewritten via expert panel process
  - Round 1: 78.2/100 → Round 2: 88.2 → Round 3: 96.4/100 ✅
  - New copy: pain→solution→features→comparison→FAQ→CTA structure
  - Stripped fake testimonials, added honest positioning
  - Updated via browser automation (clipboard API paste into ProseMirror)
  - Taylor saved both listings manually (my save didn't persist due to ProseMirror state)
  - Expert review files: `projects/invoice-tracker/expert-panel-review-r1.md`, `expert-panel-review-r2.md`

- **Lite (Free)** listing copy also rewritten
  - Score: 93.7/100 ✅
  - Concise, compelling, natural upsell to $27 toolkit
  - Expert review: `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-expert-panel.md`
  - Taylor published the Lite listing (was "not for sale" → now published)

### GTM Plan Shared
- Phase 1: 10 free Lite downloads to unlock Gumroad Discover (Reddit, X, direct outreach)
- Phase 2: Organic Discovery via marketplace
- Phase 3: Pinterest + Tailwind, SEO landing page, Notion Gallery
- Phase 4: Etsy, video walkthrough

### Technical Issues
- JSON parse error ("position 2661") appearing in Telegram chat — OpenClaw serialization bug, likely from long HTML strings with special chars. Intermittent, not data-loss.
- ProseMirror editors don't save with innerHTML injection — must use clipboard API + Cmd+V, then human clicks Save.
- Lesson learned: for Gumroad editor automation, use `navigator.clipboard.write()` with `ClipboardItem` containing `text/html` blob, then `Cmd+V`. This preserves headings and formatting.

### AUTONOMOUS.md
- Taylor reminded me to follow AUTONOMOUS.md v3.3
- Currently in Lean Mode (3 agents: Jeff, Bolt, Fury)
- Working on Tier 1 autonomous tasks: GTM content drafts, weather bot fix, landing page build

## Next Actions (In Progress)
- [ ] Draft Reddit posts + X thread for first 10 downloads → `content-queue/review/`
- [ ] Fix weather bot position limit enforcement
- [ ] Build Netlify landing page HTML

### Bias for Action Directive (11:47 AM)
- Taylor directed: **stop asking, start doing**
- Updated AUTONOMOUS.md: Added "Bias for Action" core principle at top of quick reference
- Demoted original content, outreach, deploys, architecture from Tier 3 → Tier 2
- Tier 3 now only: spending money, controversy, large changes (>100 files/>$50)
- Updated AGENTS.md: External actions (posting, outreach, deploys) are now "do freely"
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md: Added bias for action reminder
- **This is a permanent operating change** — execute first, report after, course-correct as needed

### X Profile Optimization (12:00 PM)
- Sub-agent completed `x-profile-optimization` research (3m57s)
- **4 deliverables:**
  1. `research/x-account-optimization.md` — full playbook (bio, posting cadence 4-10/day, algorithm tips)
  2. `research/x-accounts-to-follow.md` — 50 curated accounts in 7 categories
  3. `content-queue/review/_expert-panel-x-profile.md` — current: 19.5/100, post-optimization: 95.9/100 ✅
  4. `content-queue/x-profile-implementation.md` — 5-tier prioritized checklist + daily/weekly routines

### X Profile Implementation (12:10 PM)
- Taylor approved implementing all 4 files
- **Profile updated via browser:**
  - Name: "Jeff | Notion Templates"
  - Bio: "Building Notion templates for freelancers 📋 / Free invoice tracker ↓ / More tools coming soon"
  - Location: East Coast, USA
  - Website: jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com
- **Version 2 single post tweeted:** https://x.com/i/status/2021270924821950468 (feature-focused)
- **Sub-agent spawned to follow 30 accounts** (Phase 1 from curated list) — already at 3 following
- **Sub-agent spawned for GTM expert panel** — reviewing all 6 content pieces to 95+
- **Avatar upload:** Taylor sent cartoon face image. Saved to `projects/invoice-tracker/x-avatar.jpg`. Browser file input doesn't trigger X's React crop dialog — needs manual upload by Taylor.
- **Banner image:** Still needed (1500x500)

### AGENTS.md Update (12:10 PM)
- Taylor requested: private data sharing changed from "ask first" → **"never do"** (hard rule)
- Taylor building closed loop system for spending money (keeping that as ask-first)
- Updated AGENTS.md accordingly

### Lite Gumroad Images
- Cover HTML template: `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-launch/lite-cover.html` (1280x720)
- Thumbnail HTML template: `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-launch/lite-thumbnail-600.html` (600x600)
- Installed Playwright Chromium for rendering — rendering in progress when compaction hit

### Technical Lessons
- `bird tweet` CLI uses Chrome cookies (not Safari) — Safari cookie read fails with EPERM
- X character limit: Version 2 post was 186 chars over, trimmed and reposted successfully
- X file input upload via CDP `setFileInputFiles` doesn't trigger React's internal change handlers — crop dialog never appears. Manual upload required for avatar/banner.
- Browser tab IDs change between sessions: original `F0EB3D98F353D8761EBBBEE9F491E847` became `A66B140343799DC011FF8B0C1366FD3C`
