## Session Summary
- Continued work on Lite Gumroad listing assets and launch prep
- Lite listing copy finalized in `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-launch/01-gumroad-listing-copy.md`
- HTML templates for cover/thumbnail modified for Lite version
- Existing lite assets: `lite-thumbnail.png` (226KB), `thumb-raw.png` (146KB) — dimensions unverified
- Still need: 1280x720 cover and 600x600 thumbnail rendered for Lite

## Status
- Taylor said he'd set up the Lite Gumroad listing (`free-invoice-tracker` slug) — waiting on him
- Taylor also needs to: publish Lite Notion template to web, add heading+divider manually
- Weather bot needs risk tuning (position limits enforced pre-trade, not post-flag)
- AUTONOMOUS.md v3.3 approved and ready for implementation
- Content queue infrastructure created but not yet populated
