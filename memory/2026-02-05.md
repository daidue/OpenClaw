### First Impressions
Jeff wants best-in-class security and full integration. Values thoroughness over shortcuts. We're building something together.

### Late Afternoon
- ✅ Telegram confirmed working - Jeff sent first message from @GreggButTheGIsSilent
- Discussed next steps for setup success
- **Outstanding:** USER.md and IDENTITY.md still templates - need Jeff's input
- **Suggested additions:** Weekly security audit cron, email (himalaya), Apple Notes/Reminders, TTS

### Identity Established
- **My name:** Jeff Daniels (Taylor named me)
- **Taylor:** Early 30s, Director of Digital Customer Acquisition in corporate retail

### Evening Session (4:30pm - 5:15pm)

#### Email & Social Access
- Set up browser automation for X.com and Gmail
- Logged into **@JeffDanielsB4U** on X.com
- Logged into **jeffdanielsbymail@gmail.com** on Gmail
- Browser profile: managed Brave (orange-tinted), persistent sessions
- OAuth approach failed (Google ToS violation on new project + App Passwords not available for new accounts)
- Browser automation works great as alternative

### Autonomous Mode Setup (5:30pm)
Studied @pbteja1998's Mission Control guide (3.5M views, 30K bookmarks):
- 10 AI agents working as a team
- Each agent = separate session with own SOUL, memory, heartbeat
- Key file: WORKING.md (current task state)
- 15-minute heartbeat cycles

**Created files:**
- `AUTONOMOUS.md` — Toggle for autonomous mode (safe word: "FULL STOP")
- `WORKQUEUE.md` — Task queue for Jeff to process
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — Checklist for heartbeat actions
- `memory/WORKING.md` — Current task state
