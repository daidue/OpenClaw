### First Impressions
Jeff wants best-in-class security and full integration. Values thoroughness over shortcuts. We're building something together.

### Late Afternoon
- ✅ Telegram confirmed working - Jeff sent first message from @GreggButTheGIsSilent
- Discussed next steps for setup success
- **Outstanding:** USER.md and IDENTITY.md still templates - need Jeff's input
- **Suggested additions:** Weekly security audit cron, email (himalaya), Apple Notes/Reminders, TTS

### Identity Established
- **My name:** Jeff Daniels (Taylor named me)
- **Taylor:** Early 30s, Director of Digital Customer Acquisition in corporate retail
- **His goal:** Leave corporate, build revenue streams for financial freedom
- **Family:** Wife + dog Lola
- **Interests:** NFL, boxing, fitness, cooking, traveling, photography, Pokemon cards, fishing
- **Our mission:** Create opportunities/businesses for financial freedom — we're partners in this

### Updated Config
- Timezone changed to America/New_York (EST) to match Taylor
- Heartbeat active hours: 8am-10pm EST

### Evening Session (4:30pm - 5:15pm)

#### Email & Social Access
- Set up browser automation for X.com and Gmail
- Logged into **@JeffDanielsB4U** on X.com
- Logged into **jeffdanielsbymail@gmail.com** on Gmail
- Browser profile: managed Brave (orange-tinted), persistent sessions
- OAuth approach failed (Google ToS violation on new project + App Passwords not available for new accounts)
- Browser automation works great as alternative

#### Scheduled Tasks Created
- **healthcheck:security-audit** — Sundays 9am EST (deep security audit)
- **healthcheck:update-status** — Daily 8am EST (check for updates)

### Skills Installed
- **bird** (X/Twitter CLI) — `brew install steipete/tap/bird`
- **clawhub** (skill marketplace) — `npm install -g clawhub`
- **GitHub CLI authenticated** as `daidue`

### Autonomous Mode Setup (5:30pm)
Studied @pbteja1998's Mission Control guide (3.5M views, 30K bookmarks):
- 10 AI agents working as a team
- Each agent = separate session with own SOUL, memory, heartbeat
- Key file: WORKING.md (current task state)
- 15-minute heartbeat cycles

**Created files:**
- `AUTONOMOUS.md` — Toggle for autonomous mode (safe word: "FULL STOP")
- `WORKQUEUE.md` — Task queue for Jeff to process
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — Checklist for heartbeat actions
- `memory/WORKING.md` — Current task state

### Multi-Agent Expansion (evening)
- Created researcher agent "Fury" (claude-sonnet-4-5)
- Fury heartbeat: every 15 min at :02, :17, :32, :47
- Cron job: fury-heartbeat
- Architecture: main (Jeff, opus) → researcher (Fury, sonnet) → future expansion

### Squad Status (Final)
| Agent | Role | Model | Heartbeat |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| main (Jeff) | Squad Lead | claude-opus-4-5 | 30 min |
| researcher (Fury) | Deep Research | claude-sonnet-4-5 | 15 min |
| content (Nova) | Content & Social | claude-sonnet-4-5 | 15 min |
| dev (Bolt) | Coding & Technical | claude-sonnet-4-5 | 15 min |

### First Squad Deployment (6:00-8:30pm)

**Polymarket Arbitrage:**
- Fury researched opportunity — $39.6M extracted by others, validated
- 6-month window before institutional squeeze
- Bolt built paper trading scanner at ~/polymarket-arb/
- Hourly cron job running (polymarket-scanner)
- Decision: Paper trade $10K before real capital

**Freelance Invoice Tracker Template:**
- Fury mined Reddit for template ideas → Invoice Tracker won
- Target: $37, freelancers, 60M+ market
- Nova wrote all marketing copy (MARKETING_ASSETS.md)
- Bolt wrote full Notion build guide (NOTION_BUILD_GUIDE.md)
- Fury did competitor teardown + Reddit strategy (LAUNCH_INTELLIGENCE.md)
- Created TEMPLATE_BUILD_WALKTHROUGH.md — step-by-step plan
- All files copied to ~/Desktop/Invoice-Tracker-Launch/
- **Plan:** Build Fri-Sun, launch Tuesday, first sales by Friday

**YouTube Faceless Research:**
- Fury researched headless YouTube channels
- Pokemon pack openings specifically: NOT recommended
  - ASMR/voice required (pure hands-only fails)
  - Money pit ($150-250/mo pack costs)
  - 18-24 months to maybe break even
  - <5% reach profitability
- Better angle: Pokemon card investment/market analysis (higher CPM, less saturated)
- Verdict: Long expensive bet vs templates/Polymarket

### Key Decisions Made
- Start with templates + Polymarket (fast, low capital)
- YouTube is long-term experiment only, not primary play
- Taylor builds Notion template this weekend
- Squad proved operational — 4 agents, delegated tasks successfully

_Partnership officially begins. Let's build something._
