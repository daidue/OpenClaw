## Morning Session

### Gumroad Lite Images Uploaded ✅
- Taylor confirmed Gumroad is updated — Lite cover + thumbnail now live
- One of the 3 blocked items resolved

### Notion Gallery Submission — In Progress
- Navigated to notion.so/profile/templates — requires login
- Login page open in openclaw browser, waiting for Taylor to sign in via Google
- Submission copy ready: "Freelance Invoice Tracker", Freelance/Finance category, Lite version link
- Taylor initiated this — said "Let's log into Notion and submit to the official gallery"

### Cron Status
- `reddit-sales-loop`: BROKEN — timed out (300s) + Node.js module error. Needs fix (browser automation unreliable in isolated cron sessions)
- `community-outreach-research`: First run scheduled for Wed 11am
- `infra:cross-signal-detection`: Running clean, 0 signals
- `healthcheck:update-status`: OpenClaw 2026.2.9 is latest
- `morning-standup`: Ran at 8:30am, no overnight work to report
- `evening-checkin`: Ran last night at 8pm

### Strategic Context
- **Fiverr eliminated** (Taylor decision, 6:07pm yesterday)
- **Revenue pivot confirmed**: Kill noise, sell invoice tracker via Reddit/directories/communities
- **Priority today**: Get first 10 free Lite downloads, Reddit outreach, Notion Gallery submission
