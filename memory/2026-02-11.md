## Pinterest Setup ✅
- **Account:** `pinterest.com/jeffthenotionguy` (Business account)
- **Username changed** from `jeffdanielsbymail` → `jeffthenotionguy`
- **Bio:** "Professional Notion templates for freelancers & solopreneurs ⚡ Invoice tracking, client management & productivity tools that actually work. Free starter kit available!"
- **Website:** jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com (linked)
- **7 boards created:**
  1. Notion Templates for Freelancers
  2. Invoice & Finance Templates
  3. Freelance Business Tips
  4. Productivity Hacks for Freelancers
  5. Notion Tips & Tutorials
  6. Small Business Organization

- **5 pin designs rendered as PNGs** at `projects/pinterest/pins/` — Powerhouse, Chaos to Calm, Minimal Elegant, Social Proof, Bold List
- Sent 3 pin previews to Taylor on Telegram — awaiting approval to publish

## Etsy Setup — In Progress
- Taylor created Etsy account via Gmail, got to "Shop preferences" page
- **Bank verification needed** — 1-2 business day wait before shop can be finalized
- Etsy is on the "How you'll get paid" step (saw tab in browser)
- **Etsy strategy research done** — `research/etsy-strategy-final.md` (expert panel: 96.0/100)
- **Pinterest strategy research done** — `research/pinterest-strategy-final.md` (expert panel: 96.2/100)
- Expert panel recommended: price Lite at $3 on Etsy (vs free on Gumroad)

## Reddit Sales Loop — Working
- 10:30 AM sweep: 3 comments posted (2 r/Notion karma builders, 1 r/freelance strategic drop)
- Got a thank-you reply from prior comment
- Recommendation to expand to r/Notiontemplates and r/smallbusiness

## Notion Gallery Submission
- "Submit for review" was clicked previous session — still need to verify success

## Prototion Submission
- Still showing "Uploading Thumbnail..." — need to confirm + add help@prototion.com as Gumroad affiliate at 20%

## Key Decisions
- Taylor approved executing on both Etsy AND Pinterest
- Taylor said "review with the team" = run expert panel on both strategies
- Pinterest can go live today (no payment needed); Etsy blocked on bank verification
- Expert panel suggestion: $3 minimum for Lite on Etsy (different from Gumroad $0 strategy)

## Browser Notes
- Pinterest board creation: `[aria-label="Create a Pin or a board"]` → menuitem "Board" → dialog with input. After creating, page navigates to new board URL — must navigate back to profile for next board.
- Tab bloat continues — 80+ tabs/iframes in openclaw browser profile
