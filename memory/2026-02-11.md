### All 3 Blockers Cleared (9:08 AM)
- ✅ Gumroad Lite images uploaded (Taylor)
- ✅ X avatar uploaded (Taylor)
- ✅ Notion Gallery submitted
- Taylor says: "ping me occasionally with progress updates"

### Cron Status
- `reddit-sales-loop`: BROKEN — timed out (300s) + Node.js module error. Needs fix (browser automation unreliable in isolated cron sessions)
- `community-outreach-research`: First run scheduled for Wed 11am
- `infra:cross-signal-detection`: Running clean, 0 signals
- `healthcheck:update-status`: OpenClaw 2026.2.9 is latest
- `morning-standup`: Ran at 8:30am, no overnight work to report
- `evening-checkin`: Ran last night at 8pm

### Strategic Context
- **Fiverr eliminated** (Taylor decision, 6:07pm yesterday)
- **Revenue pivot confirmed**: Kill noise, sell invoice tracker via Reddit/directories/communities
- **Priority today**: Get first 10 free Lite downloads, Reddit outreach, Notion Gallery submission
