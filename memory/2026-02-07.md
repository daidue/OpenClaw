## Template Overhaul Project Started (7:40 PM)

### Project Plan
- Created `TEMPLATE-OVERHAUL.md` with 8 workstreams
- Fury researching design system (WS1) — deep dive on Easlo, Thomas Frank, Marie Poulin etc.

### Phase 1 Progress (7:40-8:00 PM)
1. **17 cover images generated** — HTML→PNG, color-coded by category:
   - Navy: Core databases (Dashboard, Invoices, Clients, Projects, Time, Expenses, Meeting Notes)
   - Green: Getting Paid content (Follow-Up Scripts, Pricing, Getting Paid)
   - Warm: Templates (Tax Prep, Contract, Invoice PDF)
   - Purple: Onboarding (Start Here, Quick Wins, Resources)
   - Slate: Settings
2. **15 covers applied to Notion pages** via API (uploaded to tmpfiles.org, set as external covers)
3. Cover template system at `Desktop/Invoice-Tracker-Launch/assets/covers/`
4. Updated sample data earlier: 7 invoices, 5 clients, relations fixed, rollups working
5. Dashboard stat cards updated to show dollar amounts

### Still TODO (will continue across sessions):
- WS2: Remaining visual polish (callout consistency, spacing, descriptions)
- WS3: Dynamic dashboard (linked DB views instead of hardcoded)
- WS4: Expand to 15-20 invoices, 8-10 clients, time entries, expenses
- WS5: Board/Calendar/Gallery views (Taylor UI work)
- WS6: Template buttons for scripts
- WS7: Redesign Start Here unboxing
- WS8: Final QA and marketplace submission
