## Design System Overhaul
- Fury completed design system research (63KB) → `research/notion-design-system.md`
- Applied to template: 17 icons updated, 17 covers (generated, uploaded to imgur, applied, then REMOVED per Taylor's preference for minimalist look)
- ~30 callouts switched from filled backgrounds to outlined/default
- Sample data expanded: 13 clients, 20 invoices, 12 time entries, 8 expenses
- Cleaned up duplicate data from parallel Bolt execution (archived ~40 dupes)
- Cover images reverted — Taylor prefers clean/minimalist, no custom banners

## Go-To-Market Strategy
- Built comprehensive GTM doc → `content/go-to-market-strategy.md`
- Researched Easlo ($239K), Pascio ($275K), Modest Mitkus ($20-30K/mo) strategies
- Fury ran 10-expert panel review → `research/go-to-market-expert-review.md` (17K words)

### Key Strategic Shifts (from expert panel):
1. Product Hunt is DEAD for templates (stopped featuring them 2024) — removed from plan
2. Pinterest is the missing goldmine ($0→$1,400/mo case study with Tailwind automation)
3. Notion Gallery should be Day 1 priority (#1 channel for built-in buyers)
4. Reddit is Month 2, not Week 1 (needs 30+ days karma building first)
5. Price should be $27, not $37 (too high for cold traffic from strangers)
6. Email capture is Day 1 priority (Carrd landing page for Lite version)
7. Gumroad Discover needs 10 transactions to unlock — Lite PWYW gets us there

## Launch Execution (Tonight)
- Built Lite version in Notion: `30104dbe-0785-812f-be10-f8f8d33019c1`
- Created 7 Pinterest pins (1000x1500) → `assets/pinterest/pin-1.png` through `pin-7.png`
- Wrote landing page copy + built HTML template → `content/carrd-landing-page.html`
- Nova wrote Medium article → `content/medium-article.md`
- Fury researching marketplace submissions (in progress)
- Created comprehensive launch checklist → `LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md`

## Pricing Decision
- Changed from $37 to $27 per expert panel consensus
- Early bird concept dropped — $27 IS the price until social proof built
- Lite version: pay-what-you-want (min $0) for lead gen + Gumroad Discover unlocking

## Active Agents
- Fury: marketplace submission research (in progress)
- Nova: completed Medium article

## Polymarket
- Hourly scans at 20:00 and 21:00 — no opportunities, $0 P&L, $10K paper portfolio unchanged
