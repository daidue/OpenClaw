## Morning Standup Fix
- Discovered cron jobs weren't firing due to missing `to:` field in delivery config
- Fixed both `morning-standup` and `evening-planning` jobs with proper Telegram delivery target (`to: "5742924372"`)
- Force-ran morning standup successfully — Telegram delivery confirmed
- Cron run history now records properly

## Security Config Applied
- Applied baseline exec security config to `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`
- Per-agent allowlists for main, researcher, content, dev
- Safe bins configured: jq, grep, cut, sort, uniq, head, tail, tr, wc, cat, awk, sed
- Mode: `security: allowlist`, `ask: on-miss`, `askFallback: deny`

## Invoice Tracker Research Complete
Fury delivered comprehensive competitive intel (24KB):
- **SaaS analysis:** FreshBooks, Wave, Bonsai, HoneyBook, AND.CO (shut down 2025)
- **Template scan:** Gumroad, Etsy, Notion marketplace
- **Key insight:** $37 price point vs $228-1,548/year SaaS

**Taylor's selected differentiators:**
1. Cashflow forecasting — predict income gaps
2. Client health scores — 🟢🟡🔴 payment reliability
3. Rate calculator — stop undercharging
4. Works on FREE Notion — tested, guaranteed
5. Deposit playbook — scripts for slow-paying clients

**Deliverable:** `research/invoice-tracker-competitive-intel.md`

## Mission Control + Convex Complete
- Convex cloud database connected (project: zany-bulldog-639)
- All three pages now use Convex (real-time, persistent):
  - Activity Feed → `activities` table
  - Calendar → `cronJobs` table  
  - Search → `memories` table
- Synced all 20 workspace .md files to Convex
- Synced 6 cron jobs to Convex
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Convex Dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/zany-bulldog-639

## Mission Control Enhancement Design
Bolt delivered comprehensive design doc (22KB, 806 lines):

**Recommended architecture:**
1. **Memory Watcher** — chokidar daemon, real-time file sync (<1s)
2. **Activity Sync** — JSONL buffer + 30s periodic sync, cursor-based
3. **Bulk Sync** — CLI tool for on-demand full sync

**Key decisions:**
- Daemons over cron (real-time UX)

## Mission Control Design Review Complete
Fury reviewed Bolt's enhancement design, found 4 critical blockers + 6 important issues.

**Critical Blockers:**
1. Credential management — daemons can't access Next.js env vars
2. Cursor corruption — JSONL sync can break on concurrent writes
3. OpenClaw hooks undefined — assumes plugin system that may not exist
4. Missing Convex schema — no table definitions or mutation implementations

**Important Issues:**
- No log rotation (JSONL grows unbounded)
- No health checks (crash loops possible)
- No monitoring dashboard
- No rollback plan
- Sensitive data could leak into logs
- Race conditions in file watcher

**Review deliverable:** `research/mission-control-review.md`

## Team Mobilized for Fixes (11:21 AM)
Taylor approved full remediation. Spawned:
- **Fury** → researching OpenClaw activity integration feasibility
- **Bolt** → implementing all critical + should-fix items:
  - SQLite for activity logging (replacing JSONL cursor)
  - Proper Convex schema + mutations
  - Health checks + crash loop prevention
  - Status dashboard (/status page)
  - Error handling with backoff
  - Setup/teardown scripts
  - Rollback documentation
- JSONL buffer (crash-safe, OpenClaw just appends)
- LaunchAgents for auto-start on boot
- Decoupled services (restart independently)

**Deliverable:** `research/mission-control-enhancements.md`

**Status:** Design complete, awaiting Taylor's approval to implement

## Squad Activity
- **Fury:** Completed invoice tracker research, heartbeats working
- **Bolt:** Completed Mission Control enhancement design
- **Main (Jeff):** Orchestrated all work, fixed cron, integrated Convex

## Next Up
- Implement Mission Control enhancements (Phase 1-3)
- Test cron jobs firing correctly over 24h period
- Build Invoice Tracker Notion template (~9 hours estimated)
