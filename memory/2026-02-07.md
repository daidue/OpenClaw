# 2026-02-07 — Daily Log

## Morning/Afternoon Session

### Mission Control Dashboard
- **All critical + important fixes completed by Bolt** (15 files created, 3 modified)
  - SQLite activity logging replacing JSONL cursor
  - Activity sync daemon with health checks + exponential backoff
  - Memory watcher daemon with chokidar + debouncing
  - Updated Convex schema with proper indexes + syncStatus table
  - Status dashboard at `/status`
  - Setup/teardown/purge scripts
  - LaunchAgent plists with ThrottleInterval (60s)
  - `DAEMON-SETUP.md` (10.7KB) + `SECURITY.md` (8.5KB)
  - Sensitive data sanitization (10 patterns)
- **Daemons not yet deployed** — next step: `bash scripts/setup-daemons.sh`
- OpenClaw `command-logger` hook integration still pending (Fury research done)

### Cron Jobs — Confirmed Working
- Morning standup (8:30 AM) and evening planning (9:00 PM) both tested + delivering to Telegram
- Fix was adding `to: "5742924372"` to delivery config

### Brave Browser WebSocket Issue
- WebSocket disconnects in Brave webchat (`code=1001`, Chromium throttling + Shields)
- Tried: pin tab, disable Shields for 127.0.0.1, disable intensive-wake-up-throttling flag
- Gateway auth only supports `"token"` or `"password"` — no auth-skip for localhost
- **Safari works fine** — may just use Safari for webchat
- Token URL: `http://127.0.0.1:18789/#token=7220950bb33f076fa135bfa5c75824aa05f4fd1a3e9a3515`

### Invoice Tracker
- Fury completed competitive research → `research/invoice-tracker-competitive-intel.md` (24KB)
- Build not yet started (~9 hours estimated)
- Key differentiators: cashflow forecasting, client health scores, rate calculator, FREE Notion, deposit playbook
- Price: $37

### Gateway Auth Investigation
- Full config retrieved from `/Users/jeffdaniels/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Schema: `gateway.auth.mode` = "token" | "password", bind = "auto"/"lan"/"loopback"/"custom"/"tailnet"
- `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` boolean available

## Next Steps
1. Deploy Mission Control daemons
2. Wire up command-logger hook to activity sync
3. Build Invoice Tracker Notion template
4. Consider just using Safari for webchat (Brave issue not worth more time)
