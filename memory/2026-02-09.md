## Major Events

### Invoice Tracker — LAUNCHED 🚀
- **Full Toolkit ($27) is LIVE** at `jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com/l/freelance-toolkit`
- Gumroad store is `jeffthenotionguy.gumroad.com` (not jeffdaniels2)
- Updated cover image and thumbnails to remove all $37 pricing references
- Price changed from $37 → $27 (copy updated on listing)
- Taylor updated the listing, added Notion share link, set up payout, published

### Lite Template Built
- Created net new Lite template page: `30204dbe-0785-8058-b01f-c49b5665ad0c`
- API key for this page: `ntn_H1304299397b3eOQcbG4SWMqT97KuDCg02t1j45kyLK1Wg`
- Contains: Invoice DB (7 properties), 4 sample invoices, 1 follow-up script, pro tips, upsell to full toolkit
- DB ID: `30204dbe-0785-81e4-ac5e-e77522c94c6b`
- Gumroad Lite listing strategy: use `free-invoice-tracker` slug, PWYW $0+, no suggested price
- Lite thumbnail and listing copy ready at `projects/invoice-tracker/lite-launch/`
- **NOT YET PUBLISHED** — Taylor needs to: publish to web with "allow duplicate", set up Gumroad listing

### Notion Sidebar Navigation
- Built collapsible sidebar nav with toggle headings (CORE/WORKFLOW/RESOURCES)
- Original synced block: `30204dbe-0785-8121-9468-e8c63f89591d`
- Deployed to 9 pages, expert panel scored 95.7/100
- **CRITICAL INCIDENT:** Bolt deleted full toolkit content while trying to clean up column wrapper. Restored from Notion trash via API (`PATCH archived: false` on block `30204dbe-0785-80f2-8b44-d0574cc18909`). All content confirmed restored.
- **LESSON: NEVER let sub-agents delete blocks on the full toolkit page. Always verify parent-child relationships before deleting any Notion block.**

### Infrastructure Build (Eric Osiu Article)
- Built all 6 systems from Eric Osiu's X article on production AI agent infrastructure
- 18 Python scripts in `infrastructure/` directory
- Systems: Context Retention (FAISS + hourly summarizer), Cross-Agent Intelligence, Memory Compounding, Voice Pipeline, Recursive 3-Pass Prompting, Feedback Router
- Phase 1 build → expert review (71.5→79.8) → Phase 2 hardening (→92.4) → final review (→93.2)
- 52 unit tests passing
- Fixed import issues (hyphenated dirs → underscore symlinks)
- Deployed: `infrastructure/deploy.sh` ran clean
- Dependencies installed: faiss-cpu, sentence-transformers, whisper, pydantic, anthropic
- **Note:** requirements.txt pins old versions — pytest was downgraded causing pytest-asyncio conflict. Fixed by reinstalling pytest 8.4.2.

### Cron Jobs Added
- `infra:hourly-summarizer` — every hour 8am-10pm EST
- `infra:daily-context-sync` — 9pm daily
- `infra:cross-signal-detection` — every 6 hours
- `infra:weekly-synthesis` — Sundays 11pm
- `infra:decision-patterns` — midnight daily

### Polymarket Weather Trading
- Taylor shared viral post (989K views) about OpenClaw weather trading bots on Polymarket
- Uses Simmer SDK from @TheSpartanLabs + NOAA forecast data
- Results cited: $1K→$24K, $65K profit on weather markets
- Relates to our existing Polymarket Scanner v2
- **Decision pending:** Build our own vs use Simmer SDK vs both

## Key Notion IDs
- Full Toolkit: `30004dbe-0785-8027-834a-eec25f5a7ff1` (API: ntn_A130...)
- Lite Template: `30204dbe-0785-8058-b01f-c49b5665ad0c` (API: ntn_H130...)
- Lite Invoice DB: `30204dbe-0785-81e4-ac5e-e77522c94c6b`

## Lessons Learned
- **Notion API block deletion is cascading** — deleting a column_list deletes ALL children (pages, databases, everything). Always check what's inside before deleting.
- **Sub-agents need explicit "DO NOT DELETE" instructions** for production data
- **Hyphenated Python directories don't work** — need underscore symlinks for imports
- **Pinned pip requirements can break other packages** — pytest downgrade broke pytest-asyncio
