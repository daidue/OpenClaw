# Evening Check-In — Monday, February 9, 2026

## Daily Summary

### Jeff (Main)
- Researched Polymarket weather trading bot (0xmovez post, 989K views)
- Analyzed Simmer SDK approach vs building our own weather strategy
- Presented 3 options to Taylor for Polymarket weather trading
- Delivered morning standup
- All scheduled cron jobs ran clean (healthcheck, hourly summarizer, cross-signal detection)

### Fury (Researcher)
- All heartbeats green, no active research tasks
- Phase 1 research (design system, Notion aesthetic) remains complete
- Standing by for Phase 2+ assignments

### Nova, Bolt, Scout, Edge, Atlas
- All agents healthy, heartbeating on schedule
- No active work queued — awaiting Phase 2 kickoff

## Overnight Work Queue
1. **No autonomous work queued** — Template Overhaul Phase 2 requires Taylor's input on cover image direction before Jeff/Bolt can build
2. Could research cover image design systems (HTML→PNG pipelines) if approved

## Decisions Needed from Taylor
1. **Polymarket Weather Trading** — Taylor shared a viral post about weather bots on Polymarket. Three options presented: (a) build our own with existing scanner + NOAA data, (b) use Simmer SDK, (c) both. Awaiting direction.
2. **Template Overhaul Phase 2 Kickoff** — Cover image system, sample data expansion, dashboard redesign. Ready to start when Taylor gives the go.

## Active Blockers
- Template Overhaul Phase 2 blocked on creative direction for cover images
- Polymarket weather strategy blocked on Taylor's decision

## Project Status Rollup

| Project | Status | Next Step |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Invoice Tracker Template | Phase 2 ready | Cover image system + sample data |
| Polymarket Scanner v2 | Research phase | Weather trading decision |
| Nate Calloway / Audience | Paused | Content posting when ready |

## Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Get Taylor's call on Polymarket weather trading
2. Kick off Template Overhaul Phase 2 (cover images, sample data)
3. Consider shipping Email Sequence Generator to ClawHub
