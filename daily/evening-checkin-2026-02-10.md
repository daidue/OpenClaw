# Evening Check-In — Tuesday, February 10, 2026

## Daily Summary

### Jeff (Main)
- **Gumroad listings rewritten** — Full ($27) scored 96.4/100, Lite (free) scored 93.7/100 via expert panel. Taylor published Lite.
- **X profile optimized** — Name, bio, location, website updated. Profile scored 95.9/100 (up from 19.5).
- **16 X replies posted** — targeting accounts with 400K+ combined views (lexfridman, mattshumer_, andrewchen, gregisenberg, etc.)
- **~27 accounts followed** on X (rate-limited at ~20, remainder via cron)
- **4 original tweets** including pinned feature list tweet
- **Template overhaul** — 18 pages got consistent icons, 17 cover images generated + applied via Notion API
- **Revenue deep think** — Brutally honest analysis: 6 days building, $0 revenue. Recommended killing Nate Calloway, pausing most projects, doubling down on selling the invoice tracker.
- **Distribution analysis** (via Fury) — Top channels: template directories, Pinterest, Reddit, Gumroad Discover
- **Product Hunt** — Submission package prepared but PH doesn't accept templates. Abandoned.
- **Autonomous infrastructure deployed** — work loop cron (hourly), X reply sprint cron (3x daily)
- **4 skills created** — autonomous-governance, x-reply-strategy, expert-panel, notion-api-builder
- **5 Quora answers drafted** (not posted — Quora onboarding blocks automation)
- **Marketplace submissions** — NotionEverything paused intake. Notion Gallery needs manual login.

### Fury (Researcher)
- Completed distribution deep think (142K tokens) — ROI ranking of all channels
- Heartbeats running clean, no assigned tasks currently

### Bolt, Nova, Scout, Edge, Atlas
- All heartbeating clean, no active tasks (Lean Mode — only Jeff + Bolt + Fury active)

## Overnight Work Queue (Jeff)

1. **Reddit karma building** — Scan r/Notion, r/freelance for invoicing threads. Post 2-3 helpful comments (no promo) to build u/JeffOnNotion karma. Browser automation in cron unreliable — may need simplified approach.
2. **Pinterest pin creation** — Sub-agent was in progress, verify completion
3. **Memory maintenance** — Consolidate today's massive daily log into MEMORY.md updates
4. **Research: Notion Discord servers** — Find 3 active servers to join for community outreach
5. **Prep Reddit promo posts** — Draft r/Notiontemplates and r/notioncreations showcase posts for when karma is sufficient

## Decisions Needed from Taylor

1. **Upload Lite images to Gumroad** — Cover + thumbnail HTML templates ready, need Taylor to upload (2 min task)
2. **Notion Gallery submission** — Needs manual Notion login at notion.so/profile/templates
3. **X avatar** — Browser can't trigger React crop dialog. Taylor needs to upload `projects/invoice-tracker/x-avatar.jpg` manually
4. **Banner image** — Still needed (1500x500). Create or approve a design?
5. **Strategic pivot approval** — Deep think recommends killing Nate Calloway, pausing Polymarket/ClawHub, going all-in on invoice tracker sales. Confirm direction?
